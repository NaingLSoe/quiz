        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "quiz": "In traditional project management, Project Manager is primarily responsible for Integration Management. In an Agile setting who is primarily responsible for integration management?", "choices": ["Project Sponsor", "Agile Coach", "Product Owner", "Agile Team"], "ans": 4, "reason": " In Agile, team members are responsible to put plans and components together."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "You are a developer on a software team. A user has approached your team about building a new feature, and has provided requirements for it in the form of a specification. She is very certain of exactly how the feature will work, and promises that there will be no changes. Which Agile value best applies to this situation?", "choices": ["Individual and interactions over processes and tool", "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation", "Responding to change over following a plan", "Working software over comprehensive documentation"], "ans": 4, "reason": " It certainly makes sense to read and understand specification. But the most effective way to truly ascertain whether or not the team really understands what she is intended to deliver working software to her so that she can see how the requirements she documented were interpreted and work with the team to determine what works well and what needs to change."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "The development team gathered to break user stories into tasks. The team is involved in which ceremony?", "choices": ["Daily Stand-up", "Iteration Planning", "All mentioned options are wrong", "Release Planning"], "ans": 2, "reason": " In the iteration planning, team discuss user stories and breaks them into tasks at the last responsible moment. Tasks are the smallest chunks of work required to build the story."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "Which of the following statement is false?", "choices": ["In Agile, most of the time, visibility of the project progress is more as compared to traditional waterfall approach", "In Agile, flexibility to accommodate change is more than traditional waterfall approach", "In Agile, business value reaches customer later as compared to traditional waterfall approach", "In Agile, risk is high at the startimg but decreases at faster rate as compared to traditional waterfall approach"], "ans": 3, "reason": " In Agile, higher business value items are delivered to the customers through prioritized product backlog and small iterative & incremental cycles."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "Team A is averaging 50 storypoints per three weeks iteration. 200 points worth of functionality is left. How many weeks would be required to complete the development work?", "choices": ["4", "0.25", "12", "3"], "ans": 3, "reason": " Number of iterations required = 200 / 50 = 4 . Number of weeks required = number of iterations * iteration duration = 4*3 = 12"},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "An Agile team is working on a critical project. Since the project is of high importance, 2 new members joined the team to quickly complete the project. What effect would this situation has on the team velocity in the next iteration?", "choices": ["Team velocity will be decreased", "Team velocity will remain same", "Team velocity will be increased", "Team should re-evaluate its velocity"], "ans": 4, "reason": " Team should re-evaluate its velocity. Addition of new members may either increase the velocity due to increased capacity or decrease velocity as training may be required which would cause team members to switch from project work."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "You are a project manager on a team building network firmware for embedded system. You have called a meeting to give a demo of the latest version of code the team has been working on for a control panel interface to a very technical group of business users and customers. This is the fifth time that you have called a meeting to do a demo like this. And for the fifth time, the user and customer asked for a specific changes. The team will now go back and work on a sixth version, and you will repeat the process again. Which of the following BEST describe this situation?", "choices": ["The users and customers doesn\u2019t know what they want", "The project need better change control and requirements management practices", "The team is delivering value early and continuously", "The team doesn\u2019t understand the requirements"], "ans": 3, "reason": " Idea behind delivering early is to get feedback so the team will go back & do the required changes."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "Organization ABC has been following Agile to execute their projects. Recently they started the complex project and the team wants to know the high level requirements so that they can start the work. How would you proceed?", "choices": ["Refer WBS", "Refer the Product Backlog", "Refer the Project Charter", "Refer the Project Roadmap"], "ans": 4, "reason": " Product Roadmap contains high level plan which depicts what all user stories will be implemented in which release."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "In the Burndown chart, line is 50 points above the projected line. What is the status of the project ?", "choices": ["Behind schedule", "Data is insufficient to share schedule status", "On time", "Ahead of schedule"], "ans": 1, "reason": " In the Burndown graph, line shows how much work is pending. Since the actual progress line is above the projected line, therefore, it means more work is pending as per planned schedule."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "Which of the following statements is true?", "choices": ["In Agile, Risk remains low throughout the project", "In Agile, Risk is low at the beginning and then increases and after sometimes it decreases.", "In Agile, Risk is high at the beginning and then decreases rapidly.", "In Agile, Risk is high at the beginning and then decreases and after sometimes it increases"], "ans": 3, "reason": " In Agile, high risk items are placed at the top of the product backlog which ensures they are developed at the earlier stage. This helps in decreasing risk rapidly as the project progresses."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "During the upcoming release planning, Epics were decomposed into smaller stories and the summation of story points of smaller stories got decreased as compared to that of epic. What effect this will have on the Burndown chart?", "choices": ["Nothing can be concluded from this information", "There will be no change", "Burndown graph will go up", "Burndown graph will go down"], "ans": 4, "reason": " Since the total number of story points got decreased after decomposing epic into smaller stories so burndown graph will go down."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "An Agile team is facing too many issues to be handled. They want to prioritize issues so that they can focus on high priority issues only. Which technique would be useful to them?", "choices": ["Fishbone analysis", "Dot Voting", "Planning Poker", "Triple Nickel"], "ans": 2, "reason": " Dot Voting is an Agile technique to prioritize issues, requirements, etc. Triple Nickel is used to generate ideas in the retrospective. Planning Poker is used for estimation and Fishbone analysis is used for root cause analysis."},
            {"id": 13, "quiz": "Sebastian is a scrum master handling the team that is working on an agile project. The team members complaints that their work is being delayed as the new sponsor (who doesn\u2019t know about the agile methodology and practices) keeps on asking them about the project details every time. What would you do in this situation as a scrum master?", "choices": ["Tell the team to take his (scrum master) permission before having any discussion with the sponsor", "Discuss with the product owner and request him to help in dealing with the new sponsor", "Discuss with the team and fix one member as the spokesperson for the sponsor", "Contact the sponsor and request him to bring all the questions to you (scrum master) only"], "ans": 4, "reason": " This is the responsibility of the Scrum Master to save development team from the interruptions."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "CEO of the company is very much interested in the breakthrough Project ABC. He directly asks development team for some changes. How should Scrum Master best responds to this request?", "choices": ["Scrum Master discuss with Product Owner how can this request be redirected properly", "Scrum Master asks development team to appoint emergent leader who can respond to such requests.", "Scrum Master himself responds to this request to protect team from outside disruptions.", "Since the request came from CEO, Scrum Master asks development team to develop changes immediately."], "ans": 1, "reason": " In Scrum, it is the responsibility of the Product Owner to maintain and refine backlog. If any request comes, Product Owner should add it into the backlog and then prioritize it so that it can be taken for development."},
            {"id": 15, "quiz": "According to Clark and Wheelwright, how many independent tasks a person can perform to maximize his productivity?", "choices": ["2 Tasks", "1 Task", "3 Tasks", "4 Tasks"], "ans": 1, "reason": " According to Clark and Wheelwright, if a person is working on 2 independent tasks then if he/she is blocked on one task then he/she can perform the switch to the second task. Beyond two task his/her productivity decreases. Productivity is 80% while doing 2 independent tasks and 70% while doing 1 task."},
            {"id": 16, "quiz": "During Scrum Retrospective, development team analysed one of the process which they want to improve in the next sprint. They created the plan on how to improve the process efficiency. Where would the team place the work involved in this improvement plan?", "choices": ["Retrospective Improvement Backlog", "Since the development team is self-organizing and self-directing, they just do the work involved in the improvement plan in the next sprint", "Sprint Backlog", "Product Backlog"], "ans": 3, "reason": " All improvement goals which the development team planned to take up in upcoming sprints are placed in the sprint backlog."},
            {"id": 17, "quiz": "In which of the following technique, development team integrates new work into the already existing product and then ensures it works as per the desired plan.", "choices": ["Continuous Implementation", "Continuous Integration", "Continuous Improvement", "Continuous Installation"], "ans": 2, "reason": " Continuous integration involves frequent integration of new piece of work into existing product and ensuring nothing breaks down during integration."},
            {"id": 18, "quiz": "You are a Scrum Master of a team that is consistently producing value and meeting their commitments. Your project sponsor approaches you to assist another team struggle in delivering the product increment at the end of every Sprint. How would you respond to such a request? Select the most appropriate response from the following?", "choices": ["Educate your sponsor that helping other teams in the organization is not part of your role.", "Partner with the product owner and Scrum Master of another team, assess their current maturity, make suggestions and offer help based on your findings", "Ask your project sponsor to talk to your manager and wait for official approval before you move to another team", "Talk team members individually and find out reasons why previous Scrum Master failed in his/her role, submit the report to your sponsor"], "ans": 2, "reason": " Helping the organization to adopt Agile is one of the Scrum Master responsibilities. Meeting individually with each team member is not a problem but focusing only on the Scrum Master may not be the right approach. Sponsor asks for the help but does not ask to move to a new team permanently."},
            {"id": 19, "quiz": "A scrum team\u2019s stakeholder discovers a new requirement and approaches a team member to build it. The team member builds a prototype for the stakeholder, who is able to start using it immediately. The product owner discovers this and demands that the team member include her in any future decisions, but the team member feels this is the most efficient way to work. The product owner and team member approach the scrum master to resolve the conflict. Who should the scrum master do?", "choices": ["Help the product owner and the team member compromise and find middle ground", "Help the product owner understand how the team member is improving stakeholder communications", "Help the team member follow the rules of Scrum by showing the correct use of user stories", "Side with product owner"], "ans": 4, "reason": " This is a case where product owner is right, and the team member is doing something that is potentially dangerous. The reason that scrum have a product owner role is so that someone can stay on top of all stakeholder communications. There is nothing wrong with the team member working directly with stakeholders, but they should Never cut the product owner out of the discussion."},
            {"id": 20, "quiz": "Michael is working in an agile environment. Currently, he is working on 2 different projects and is not able to focus properly on both the projects. In terms of Lean, what kind of waste is this?", "choices": ["Waiting", "Task switching", "Partially done work", "Motion"], "ans": 2, "reason": " Since Michael would be switching between two projects, this is an example of task switching waste."}
