This new fabrication line is time critical, and industry competition is fierce. Many of the older employees who have traditionally worked on the fabrication lines have helped the company be successful using ad hoc processes and heuristic knowledge. As the project manager, you want to use comprehensive project management best practices wherever possible to maximize the chances of success. Which of the following would you do first?", "choices": ["A.  Calculate the project timeline and initial budget", "B.  Recruit the key project skills as early as possible", "C.  Develop the project charter and scope of work", "D.  Write a comprehensive change control process"], "ans": 3, "reason": "\nC. A project charter with a well-defined scope of work is necessary to calculating timelines, calculating budgets, recruiting skills, and creating a change management process. The development of the project charter is part of the project initiation process.\nA, B, and D are incorrect because they are part of scope control and detailed planning, which follow project charter creation. A is incorrect because a project timeline and budget cannot be created without knowing what is in scope for the project. B is incorrect and should be undertaken as early as possible, but skills cannot be determined until the scope of the effort is determined. D is incorrect because the timing for a change control process is after an understanding of the scope of the effort is complete."},

You've worked on projects at your prior company and are looking to ensure that you have the authority needed to carry out your roles and responsibilities. Which project document should you ask to see first?", "choices": ["A.  Work breakdown structure", "B.  Project charter", "C.  Requirements document", "D.  Project schedule"], "ans": 2, "reason": "\nB. The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project and gives the project manager the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. A project manager is identified and assigned as early in the project as is feasible. The project manager should always be assigned prior to the start of planning, and preferably while the project charter is being developed. Without an approved charter, the project manager has no authority within the organization.\nA and D are incorrect because they are a part of the project plan, which follows from a project's charter. The work breakdown structure (WBS) itemizes the work to be done in the project. The project schedule aligns the work to be done with a calendar for completion. C is incorrect because a requirements document is created as a part of the executing phase and details the product planned to be created by the project charter."}
