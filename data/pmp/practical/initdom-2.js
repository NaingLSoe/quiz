        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "quiz": "You are creating a matrix that includes all the stakeholders on the project. On your first pass at it, you decide that it's important to know each stakeholder's power (ability to impose will), urgency (need for immediate attention), and legitimacy (their involvement) within the project. What type of grid or model are you implementing?", "choices": ["A.  Power/influence grid", "B.  Salience model", "C.  Influence/impact grid", "D.  Kano model"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The salience model describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments of their power, urgency, and legitimacy. This model is useful in large, complex communities of stakeholders. A is incorrect because the power/influence grid does not address urgency and legitimacy. C is incorrect because influence/impact does not address urgency and legitimacy. D is incorrect because the Kano model is used in requirements prioritization."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "An ongoing endeavor to produce repetitive results with resources doing the same set of tasks is known as:", "choices": ["A.  Project management", "B.  Stakeholder analysis", "C.  Program management", "D.  Operations"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Day-to-day repetitive tasks that carry out the work of the business are known as operations. Projects are not operations. A is incorrect because projects have a definite start and end and create a unique deliverable. B is incorrect because although stakeholder analysis is an ongoing process during a project, it is not performed outside of a project. C is incorrect because programs consist of projects and therefore have the same time-based nature to them and unique deliverables."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "You have an active stakeholder that can directly affect your project's success. This stakeholder is a positive supporter, but is concerned about the inferior performance of previous projects. Based on your stakeholder analysis, the best way to handle this stakeholder is to:", "choices": ["A.  Do nothing but monitor the stakeholder's actions", "B.  Keep the stakeholder informed of project activities", "C.  Manage closely to maintain the relationship", "D.  Try to identify the key areas of interest and work to keep the stakeholder satisfied"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Keeping a supportive stakeholder aware of the project and potential impacts will maintain the relationship and support for the work and its outcomes. A is incorrect because if you do nothing, the supportive stakeholder could slip into a neutral or resistant stakeholder. B is incorrect because although it is important to keep the stakeholder informed of project activities, it may not help to maintain the relationship. D is incorrect because you will have already identified the key areas of interest in the stakeholder register."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "You have identified specific resource requirements in your project charter, but your company's resources are already constrained; you only need a small core team. A best practice in this situation is to include with your project charter:", "choices": ["A.  An estimate of the resources required for the various project phases", "B.  A pre-assignment section on why the project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons", "C.  A RACI chart showing all project resources", "D.  A RACI chart that includes roles and responsibilities of your project's stakeholders"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered preassigned. A is incorrect because estimating resources required for the various project phases is done in the Planning process group. C and D are incorrect because the RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "You are preparing your project charter. You plan to have a close working relationship with the client. In the project charter, you decided to enhance your resource requirements section so you could ensure everyone understood why you need the requested resources. You decided to:", "choices": ["A.  Prepare a project organization chart showing cross-functional management and resources", "B.  Prepare a RACI chart because you also will use resources from the client on your team", "C.  Describe in an outline format the responsibilities of every member of your team", "D.  Prepare both a product breakdown structure and a resource breakdown structure"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The RACI chart is especially useful when the team consists of internal and external resources to ensure clear division of roles and responsibilities\u2014here your client will be actively involved. A is incorrect because a project organization chart showing cross-functional management and resources could be an input to this process. C is incorrect because an outline detailing the responsibilities of every member of your team is less effective than a RACI chart. D is incorrect because a product breakdown structure is not used for resource assignments, and a resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical resources related by category and resource type."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "You are attempting to identify and map your project's stakeholders. Which representation technique can you use?", "choices": ["A.  Sender-receiver model", "B.  Stakeholder cube", "C.  Probability/impact grid", "D.  Code-decode model"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. A stakeholder cube uses the three axes of Attitude, Power, and Interest, each running from negative to positive extremes, with a node at each extreme. A is incorrect because the basic sender-receiver communication model is concerned with ensuring that the message is delivered, rather than understood. C and D are incorrect because they are distracters\u2014the terms are made-up."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "While working for a secret government agency, you discover that a previous project that was very successful had a stakeholder, Winston, who was unhappy with the benefits received. Winston can have a significant impact on your project. What should you do next?", "choices": ["A.  Review the stakeholder register to determine exactly how much impact Winston has", "B.  Communicate and work with Winston to meet his needs and expectations", "C.  Ensure that the communications management plan addresses Winston's information needs", "D.  Review the stakeholder management plan to determine Winston's engagement level"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The stakeholder register will contain the stakeholder classification, which includes the impact/influence/power/interest grids. B is incorrect because meeting with Winston will enable you to identify the appropriate focus for his engagement, not his impact on the project. C is incorrect because the communications plan describes how project communications will be planned, structured, implemented, and monitored for effectiveness; it will be used later. D is incorrect because reviewing the stakeholder management plan comes after you classify stakeholders in the stakeholder register."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "You are a project manager carrying out the first adaptive project for the company. For each iteration, you will need to ensure your team carries out all the following except:", "choices": ["A.  Collect Requirements", "B.  Define Scope", "C.  Create WBS", "D.  Develop Project Charter"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. A project charter would be created one time, at the beginning of the first iteration. In each successive iteration, small working products would be delivered through the cycle of collecting requirements, defining the scope of what will be worked on within the next iteration, and creating a work breakdown structure of tasks and deliverables in the iteration. A is incorrect because an iteration in an adaptive project is driven by the requirements, fine-tuning a small set of requirements and creating a working product for those requirements. B is incorrect because defining the scope of what will and will not be done in each iteration is crucial to the success of the iteration. C is incorrect because understanding the tasks of what must be done in each iteration defines who will be needed to accomplish the tasks, thus making this an essential step."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "For your current project, you have determined that the probability of meeting the schedule objective is 80% and the probability of being on budget is 70%. You inherited this project from a previous manager and are disappointed that a better effort wasn't made in this forecasting when the objectives were put in place. Which of the following would you have used to assess the objectives at the beginning of the project?", "choices": ["A.  MoSCoW", "B.  POLDAT", "C.  RACI", "D.  SMART"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. A common test for assessing objectives is to ensure that they are SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound. A is incorrect because MoSCow (must, should, could, won't) is used in prioritizing requirements in an adaptive project. B is incorrect because POLDAT (process, organization, and location and data) is a model used to understand a company's assets. C is incorrect because a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) chart is used to identify and manage stakeholders and their expectations."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "The training division in your company has started a new project they believe will be a best-seller, and they have brought you on board as the project manager.

Improve or fix products, processes, or services", "D.  Implement or change business or technological strategies"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. High-level strategic needs are based on stakeholder needs with stakeholders at any level in the company. A is incorrect because regulatory, legal, and social requirements are tied to outside influences not directly related to profitability. C is incorrect because this is a new product, not an improvement on an existing product. D is incorrect because the training division preexisted, so creating courses was within the existing business strategy."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "You were just asked to lead a project that many people are calling a stakeholder nightmare. You will be dealing with multiple stakeholders, both inside and outside the company, and the stakeholders are all very vocal. In addition, the project is regulatory in nature. In which of the following processes would you decide how you will involve stakeholders on your current project with the goal of connecting with them based on their needs, expectations, and interests?", "choices": ["A.  Identify Stakeholders", "B.  Plan Stakeholder Engagement", "C.  Manage Stakeholder Engagement", "D.  Monitor Stakeholder Engagement"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Plan Stakeholder Engagement follows Identify Stakeholders and is where you think through how to engage the variety of stakeholders on the project based on their needs, expectations, and interests. A is incorrect because the goal of Identify Stakeholders is to build a comprehensive list of stakeholders. C is incorrect because managing engagement takes place after identifying stakeholders and planning how to engage them. D is incorrect because monitoring takes place throughout the project after having decided on engagement strategies."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "The project charter is an input into which two Project Stakeholder Management processes?", "choices": ["A.  Identify Stakeholders and Plan Stakeholder Engagement", "B.  Manage Stakeholder Engagement and Monitor Stakeholder Engagement", "C.  Identify Stakeholders and Manage Stakeholders", "D.  Plan Stakeholder Engagement and Manage Stakeholder Engagement"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The project charter is needed to define the business need, which drives the stakeholders that will be involved and the nature of their involvement. B is incorrect because the project charter is not an input to Manage Stakeholder Engagement or Monitor Stakeholder Engagement. C is incorrect because Manage Stakeholders is a made-up term. D is incorrect because the project charter is not an input to Manage Stakeholder Engagement."},

Company research", "B.  Analyses of high-profile project disasters", "C.  The increase in project successes in the past ten years", "D.  Program and portfolio management"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The lessons learned from visible project disasters highlight stakeholder involvement as a critical success factor. A is incorrect because although company research may have taken place on this topic, it is not clear what the company research may have been about in this case. C is incorrect because this is a random statistic that cannot be proven by the question. D is incorrect because program and portfolio management are not directly involved with project stakeholders and their needs."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "You are taking your first pass at identifying stakeholders for your current project. Which project document should you consult as a source of information about this project's stakeholders?", "choices": ["A.  Project charter", "B.  Business case", "C.  Stakeholder register", "D.  RACI chart"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The business case is provided by the project sponsor and is a needed input to the develop project charter process. A is incorrect because the project charter is not a source for the initial stakeholders, but it does document the benefits once analyzed in the business case. C is incorrect because the stakeholder register is an output of Identify Stakeholders, not an input. D is incorrect because a RACI chart is developed once roles and responsibilities for identified stakeholders have been decided."},
            {"id": 15, "quiz": "In which process group does the stakeholder identification start in a project?", "choices": ["A.  Initiating", "B.  Planning", "C.  Executing", "D.  Monitoring and Controlling"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The initiating phase is where stakeholders are first identified; this identification is reviewed throughout each project phase.

As the general contractor, you have residential construction experience and have helped the couple decide what kind of house to build given their budget, and you found them a builder that can fulfill their requirements. You are the person managing all interactions on behalf of the homeowners, interacting with the builder, the city municipalities, and the neighbors. You have eyes on the project at every phase and are handling the problems during the build. What project role are you serving?", "choices": ["A.  Sponsor", "B.  Project manager", "C.  Business analyst", "D.  None, this is not a project"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The general contractor is managing groups of people and not actually doing the construction and is therefore acting as a project manager. A is incorrect because the homeowners are the project sponsors; they control the funding and the overall direction of the project. C is incorrect because the business analyst records the high-level and low-level requirements, but does not manage all the interactions. D is incorrect because this is a project as it has a definite start, end, and unique deliverable."},
            {"id": 17, "quiz": "As the general contractor for a homeowner, the project has kicked off and you need to ensure that all departments in the municipal government are on board with the plans to build a house on the beach. The house may be in a flood zone, and it is in a coastal preservation zone. To ensure that all requirements from the couple and the municipal government are met, which process is critical?", "choices": ["A.  Develop Project Charter", "B.  Identify Stakeholders", "C.  Direct and Manage Project Work", "D.  Plan Communications Management"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Identifying all stakeholders is the only way to uncover all project requirements. A is incorrect because the project has already kicked off and the charter is assumed at this point. C is incorrect because it will be pointless to perform the Direct and Manage Project Work process if the stakeholders have not been properly identified, as the stakeholders are the source of requirements driving the work. D is incorrect because planning communications can only be successful if all stakeholders have been identified."},

The house is framed and the water lines connected; however, the couple was just told that the cost to connect to the municipality's sewer system is not a task performed by the municipality, but instead is performed by a contractor hired by the homeowners to do the work. Which process should have discovered this information earlier in the project?", "choices": ["A.  Develop Project Charter", "B.  Identify Stakeholders", "C.  Direct and Manage Project Work", "D.  Plan Communications Management"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. If the stakeholder who had knowledge of the municipalities sewer requirements and process had been identified in the beginning of the project, it would not have been a surprise communication late in the project. A is incorrect because the project charter does not identify all the stakeholders. C is incorrect because directing and managing the work can only take place if the work has been identified through stakeholder requirements first. D is incorrect because planning who to communicate with is ineffective if the 'who' has yet to be identified."},

Identify Stakeholders", "B.  Plan Stakeholder Engagement", "C.  Plan Communications Management", "D.  Monitor Stakeholder Engagement"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Identifying stakeholders leads to knowing who they are and what engagement focus is appropriate. B is incorrect because identification describes the needs of the stakeholders so that engagement can be planned. C is incorrect because planning communication cannot take place without knowing the stakeholders and how they wish to be engaged. D is incorrect because it is an ongoing task that ensures all is on track."},
            {"id": 20, "quiz": "Which of the following are documents that are generally originated outside of the project but are used as input to the project?", "choices": ["A.  Business requirements document", "B.  Business documents", "C.  Stakeholder requirements document", "D.  Project change control process"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Business documents are provided by the sponsor as an input to the develop project charter process. A is incorrect because the business requirements document may be developed within the project as a part of the project charter.

The creation of the business requirements", "D.  A shared understanding of success criteria"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. This approach results in a shared understanding of success criteria across all stakeholder groups and helps ensure a positive project outcome. A is incorrect because a timeline for completion is a task and deliverable, not a benefit. B is incorrect because the division of labor is part of delegating tasks and is not a benefit. C is incorrect because business requirements are not a benefit, but a must-have for a project."},

The project and the strategic objectives of the company", "D.  The funding and the deliverables"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Each project is undertaken for the benefit of the company, and the charter brings together the 'why' of the project with how it aligns to strategic goals. A is incorrect because a project manager is given authority in the project charter; the manager may change, but the charter doesn't have to simultaneously change. B is incorrect because the timeline is not set in the project charter. D is incorrect because the funding and deliverables are both identified in the charter, but funding is not a fixed amount for most projects."},

B is incorrect because solution requirements are developed during the collect requirements process and contain lower-level product details. D is incorrect because the feasibility study would precede the project."},
