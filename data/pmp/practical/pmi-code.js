It is our duty to deal with others who engage in disrespectful behaviors. It is the PM's responsibility to correct the disrespectful behavior and take preventive action. Knowing the norms and customs of others is part of the Respect: Aspirational Standard of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. B is incorrect because talking to the whole team takes time away from their project work and is an example of *reward the guilty and punish the innocent.* C is incorrect because conflict should be addressed early, in private, and using a collaborative (win-win) approach with the team members. If the negative action(s) continue, then formal procedures may be used.

Isaac and his senior business analyst (SBA) have all the PowerPoint slides ready for the big presentation on Friday. If Isaac looks good in this meeting, it could mean a promotion to program manager. He explains the *look good = promotion* scenario to the SBA, and she agrees that it is okay just to put Isaac's name on the title slide. What should Isaac do now?", "choices": ["A.  Don't do it. It is a failure to disclose conflicts.", "B.  Sure, it's okay. It is simply an example of a coworker helping Isaac out.", "C.  Don't do it.

Colleen needs to disclose this threat to national security.", "B.  Nothing. It is only Colleen's opinion that the application will jeopardize the personal information of your customers.", "C.  Nothing. It is Colleen's choice to work for a company that may be violating the Code.", "D.  Something. PMI could bring disciplinary action, use sanctions against Colleen, and revoke her PMP certification for not reporting this unethical situation."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Only filing ethics complaints when they are substantiated by facts is an example of Mandatory: Responsibility. A is incorrect because in Aspirational: Respect, we do not gossip.

To do what is right and honorable is the vision and describes the expectations we have for ourselves and our fellow practitioners, which is the purpose of the Code. A is incorrect because even though aspiring to be a PMP is a great idea, it is not in the Code. B is incorrect because articulate ideals, both aspirational and mandatory, is in the Code; providing a roadmap to advancement is not mentioned in the Code.

A is incorrect because team meetings are for decision making, issue resolution, lessons learned, and status updates. C is incorrect because the employee assistance program does not handle unethical/illegal behavior. D is incorrect because writing a report is not needed\u2014yet.
