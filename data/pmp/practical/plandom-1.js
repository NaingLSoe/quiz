        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "quiz": "Calculate EMV for a risk event that has a 40% chance of occurring and that, if it occurred, would cost the project an additional $100,000.", "choices": ["A.  $4,000", "B.  $40,000", "C.  $100,000", "D.  $400,000"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. 40% \u00d7 $100,000 = $40,000. The three steps to calculate EMV are as follows: 1) Assign a probability of occurrence for the risk. 2) Assign the monetary value of the impact of the risk when it occurs. 3) Multiply Step 1 and Step 2. The value you get after performing Step 3 is the expected monetary value (EMV). This value is positive for opportunities (positive risks) and negative for threats (negative risks). Managing project risk requires you to address both types of project risks. A, C, and D are incorrect because the answers do not come from following the three steps of calculating EMV."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "Risk A has a 50% chance of happening. Unrelated Risk B has a 20% chance of happening. What is the chance they will both happen?", "choices": ["A.  10%", "B.  30%", "C.  70%", "D.  100%"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. 10% because 0.50 \u00d7 0.20 = 0.10 = 10%. When two events are independent, the EMV (probability) of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. More formally, if events A and B are independent, then the probability of both A and B occurring is: P(A and B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B). B, C, and D are incorrect because they were not arrived at by calculating the probability of two independent events through multiplication of the probabilities of the two events."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "If the EMV of a risk is $200,000 and this risk exposure has been documented in the project business case, what is the maximum you could spend to remove the risk completely and be better off?", "choices": ["A.  $20,000", "B.  $100,000", "C.  $2,000,000", "D.  $200,000"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. $200,000 is the maximum amount you would spend to eliminate the risk completely, which is equal to the amount of risk exposure. A, B, and C are incorrect because spending any more or less than the amount of risk exposure is not a sound project management practice."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "A residual risk is assessed to have a probability of 0.1 and an impact value of $50,000. What is the EMV of the residual risk?", "choices": ["A.  $1,000", "B.  $5,000", "C.  $50,000", "D.  EMV does not apply to residual risk."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. $5000. The three steps to calculate EMV are as follows: 1) Assign a probability of occurrence for the risk. 2) Assign a monetary value for the impact of the risk when it occurs. 3) Multiply Step 1 and Step 2. The value you get after performing Step 3 is the expected monetary value (EMV). This value is positive for opportunities (positive risks) and negative for threats (negative risks). Managing project risk requires requires you to address both types of project risks. A, C, and D are incorrect because the answers do not come from following the three steps for calculating EMV."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "How is secondary risk assessed?", "choices": ["A.  E = (a + 4m + b) / 6", "B.  EMV plus 10%", "C.  Determine probability and multiply by impact", "D.  The same way as original or residual risks"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Secondary risk is a risk that happens because you implemented a risk response. A residual risk is the risk that remains after a risk response has been taken. Secondary risks should be assessed for proper action in the same way as original risks and residual risks. A is incorrect because it is the formula for three-point estimating. B is incorrect because it is an improper calculation. C is incorrect because it is the definition of risk exposure."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "Your project charter has been approved. You are seeking approval of your project management plan. You have a meeting coming up with your project management team next week. They will be most interested in:", "choices": ["A.  Needed project team members", "B.  The overall approach you will use to manage the project", "C.  How progress will be measured and reported", "D.  The project contracts you plan to put in place"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The project management plan development process integrates the project's subsidiary plans and establishes the overall approach for managing the project. A is incorrect because you are responsible for acquiring, managing, and developing the project team members. C is incorrect because at this point it is too early to select the project performance measurements. D is incorrect because procurements and contracts are decided after you create a WBS."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "You will be using earned value management (EVM) on your current project because it is mandated by the project management office (PMO). This means you will need to use:", "choices": ["A.  A PMO member on your team", "B.  A project management information system", "C.  A dedicated EVM specialist within your team", "D.  Project-specific contract officers"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. A project management information system (PMIS) is the coherent arrangement of the information required for an organization to execute projects successfully. A PMIS is typically one or more software applications, together with a methodical process for collecting and using project information. A is incorrect because PMP members are support staff and not dedicated team members. C is incorrect because you do not need a specialist added to the team to use EVM. PMs can use spreadsheets to calculate EVM. D is incorrect because it is too early in the project to know about contracts."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "As you plan your project's resources, you should emphasize the:", "choices": ["A.  Quality metrics to be collected to evaluate the product, service, or result", "B.  Costs for each resource", "C.  Desirability of having a dedicated team for each phase of the project", "D.  Need to allocate and account for all resources"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Resource planning is done at an early stage. Work performance reports can show the details of resource allocation and usage throughout the project. A is incorrect because quality metrics are a description of the product or project attributes and how to measure them. B is incorrect because the costs for each resource are collected and used in the Determine Budget process. C is incorrect because the skills and competencies needed for each team member\u2014within each phase of the project\u2014is the Plan Resource Management process."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "As you prepare your project management plan, you decide to attach your subsidiary plans, one of which is the:", "choices": ["A.  Benefits management plan", "B.  Contract management plan", "C.  Schedule management plan", "D.  Stakeholder involvement plan"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The schedule management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan and is the only output of the Plan Schedule Management process. A is incorrect because the benefits management plan complements the project management plan. It is not a subsidiary plan. B is incorrect because although a contract management plan can be used by the contracting officer, it is not a subsidiary plan. D is incorrect because the stakeholder involvement plan does not exist; instead it is the stakeholder engagement plan that includes strategies or approaches for engaging with stakeholders."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "An effective project management practice is to enable contractors assigned to your project to have access to information in your Project Management Information System (PMIS) such as:", "choices": ["A.  Project budget information", "B.  Buy or lease decision rules", "C.  Change control/revision tools", "D.  Requirements management information"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Requirements management information is stored in a PMIS. Contractors can be more productive when allowed to use tools to capture and manage requirements for your projects/products in a structured, collaborative fashion. A and B are incorrect because budget information and buy-or-lease decisions are sensitive, company-specific information and better controlled within the company. C is incorrect because the PM is responsible for maintaining the integrity of modifications to project deliverables and documentation."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "Having been a project manager before, you were pleased to be selected to manage a software upgrade project on a nuclear power plant and have set up specific team ground rules for your project, including that:", "choices": ["A.  The steering committee members are part of the staffing management plan", "B.  The resource management plan includes all project resources", "C.  The Project Management Office (PMO) forms the dedicated project team", "D.  Your project team is part of the PMO"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The resource management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan that describes how all project resources are acquired, allocated, measured, and corrected. A is incorrect because a steering committee should be selected at the beginning of a project, usually in the preinitiation stage. In general, the steering committee is a senior management team that guides and is accountable for the project and gains management commitment. C is incorrect because the PMO is a support group. D is incorrect because your dedicated project team members are assigned to your project and are not assigned to the PMO."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "You are the lead project manager on a government contract, and you are preparing the cost management plan for the project. Given that your project is for a government agency, which of the following should you be sure to consider?", "choices": ["A.  Policy compliance and audit procedures", "B.  Annual nature of government funding", "C.  Multiple civilian and military resources that will be available to you", "D.  How the Federal Reserve decisions may affect interest rate hikes"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. DoD's annual funding policy states that the budget request for a fiscal year should be restricted to the budget authority necessary to cover all 1) expenditures expected to be made during that fiscal year and 2) costs of goods and services expected to be required during that fiscal year. A is incorrect because policy compliance is a goal set by an organization in its attempt to encourage and achieve compliance by its members/employees about the organization's policies. Audits are performed to ensure compliance. C is incorrect because resource allocation and usage are handled through the project life cycle. D is incorrect because interest rate hikes affect borrowing capacity, not funding."},
            {"id": 13, "quiz": "You are a construction project manager working on a new office building in the outskirts of your city. You are developing your project management plan that assumes a dedicated project team. The plan for the project forecasts a two-year schedule. As part of the plan, you need to consider:", "choices": ["A.  Potential increases in resource costs", "B.  The payback period for every year of the project", "C.  Design changes based on external dependencies", "D.  The need for annual cost/benefit analyses"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Direct costs include the salaries for dedicated team members on your project and contractors that provide support exclusively to your project. In multiyear projects it is likely that resource costs will increase each year, and a prudent project manager will budget for these increases. B. The payback period formula is used to determine the length of time it will take to recoup the initial amount invested on a project or investment. It is calculated at the beginning of the project. C is incorrect because 'design changes based on external dependencies' may affect the project, but the PM controls these changes. D is incorrect because cost/benefit analysis is part of the business case and completed in the initiation stage of the project."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "You are working as a project manager on a project that involves protecting grizzly bears in Alaska. Not everyone is onboard with this effort, including several external stakeholders. In developing your communications management plan, you should consider:", "choices": ["A.  Updating the communications issues log", "B.  Local laws about grizzly bears", "C.  Building a RACI chart to ensure that all stakeholders are engaged", "D.  The use of a communications assessment for unsupportive stakeholders"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. PMs face the challenges of communicating with stakeholders who have a different style of communication than their own. One of the best ways to quickly improve the effectiveness of your communication is to adapt your communication style to match theirs. This is especially true with unwilling/unsupportive/challenging stakeholders. A is incorrect because although there is disagreement about your project, after you complete the communications assessments, you could update the communications issues log. B is incorrect because obeying all local laws about grizzly bears is an external factor. C is incorrect because a RACI chart assigns roles and responsibilities to stakeholders during a project; however, it would be preferable to do a communications assessment prior to a RACI chart."},
            {"id": 15, "quiz": "Given the planning data for your project, SEMAJ, you have identified the need to use several contractors for three parts of the multiyear project. As you determine specific procurement strategies after analyzing the involved WBS elements, your next step is to:", "choices": ["A.  Analyze the project scope statement", "B.  Analyze the product description", "C.  Prepare a procurement management plan", "D.  Consider make-or-buy analysis"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Make-or-buy analysis (which can lead to a make-or-buy decision) is a process that PMs follow to know whether it's better for them to do the work in-house or pay for a third-party company to help the project team. A is incorrect because you have already analyzed the project scope statement to determine specific procurement strategies. B is incorrect because the product scope description is completed as part of scope definition. C is incorrect because the procurement management plan will include your procurement decisions after you complete the make-or-buy analysis."},
            {"id": 16, "quiz": "Your project will include the hiring of multiple third-party vendors, and you are considering the elements to include in the procurement management plan for the project. Before completing the procurement management plan, you should first:", "choices": ["A.  Review project assets on procurement", "B.  Develop activity cost estimates", "C.  Prepare a prequalified seller list", "D.  Review the WBS"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. The procurement management plan is a part of the overall project management plan, and the WBS is the best predictor of the success of a new project, including vendor assets. By reviewing the work breakdown structure before you prepare the procurement plan, it is relatively easy to determine what procurements are needed throughout the life of the project. The WBS identifies items to be procured, and the procurement plan defines the items to be procured, the types of contracts to be used in support of the project, the contract approval process, and decision criteria. A is incorrect because you are not at the point that assets for procurement would be available. B is incorrect because you prepare activity cost estimates after you create the WBS. C is incorrect because a prequalified seller list is prepared in conducting procurements, which follows the creation of the procurement management plan."},
            {"id": 17, "quiz": "The PMO is recommending that you use fixed price (FP, or lump sum, or firm fixed price) contracts on all vendor contracts because you will have the least cost risk. The contract information should be:", "choices": ["A.  Included in the contract management plan", "B.  Part of the procurement management plan", "C.  Part of the procurement statement of work", "D.  Developed by the contracts department"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Contract terms for a project are included in the procurement management plan. A is incorrect because the contract management plan is not a plan used by the PM. It may be a plan used by the contracts office. C is incorrect because the work to be done on each procurement is called a procurement statement of work (PSOW), which describes the work and activities that the seller is required to complete. The activities also include meetings, reports, and communications. Contract types are part of the PSOW. D is incorrect because the project management team is responsible for receiving bids or proposals and the application of evaluation criteria to select a seller."},
            {"id": 18, "quiz": "As you prepare your quality plan, it is important to understand:", "choices": ["A.  Quality is a variable cost in projects", "B.  Quality is cost based", "C.  Quality activities tend to be about equal from a QA and QC perspective", "D.  Quality should be determined after test cases are complete"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Quality is a variable cost in all projects and should be considered as such in project quality planning. B is incorrect because the cost of quality includes the cost impact of conformance versus nonconformance. It can also include quick cost reductions versus long-term costs to prevent product problems later in the life cycle. C is incorrect because QA activities are preferred over QC activities. QA means keeping the defect out of the process. QC means keeping the defect out of the hands of the customer. Prevention over inspection. D is incorrect because test cases should be created before quality is measured."},
            {"id": 19, "quiz": "You are the project manager setting up a new production line for innovative gadget gifts for techies. You and your team are preparing the risk management plan. You first need to define:", "choices": ["A.  Your organization's risk appetite", "B.  The functional requirements document you plan to use to identify risks", "C.  Who the resistor stakeholders are", "D.  Budget assumptions and constraints"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. In risk management, risk appetite is the level of risk an organization is prepared to accept. Risk appetite constraints are not easy to define; every organization can tolerate different levels of risk. B is incorrect because the functional requirements document may indicate project objectives that are particularly at risk and is an input to the risk management plan. C is incorrect because a resistant stakeholder will be identified in the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix in the stakeholder management plan. D is incorrect because budget assumptions and constraints will be used to keep the known risks within the identified risk thresholds."},
            {"id": 20, "quiz": "You understand that positive and negative risks may affect your project, and you have set up risk categories to help as you work on your risk management plan. One obvious category of opportunities and threats is associated with resource availability. Which type of risk is this?", "choices": ["A.  Portfolio-related", "B.  Product-level", "C.  Program-level", "D.  Project-related"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Resource availability risk is a category of potential causes of positive and negative risk and can affect the day-to-day work on the project. A and C are incorrect because each are higher-level risks and do not happen at the same time as the project work. B is incorrect because product-level risks are not usually related to resourcing."},
            {"id": 21, "quiz": "As you prepare your project's risk management plan, and since the project involves setting up a new production line for innovative gadget gifts for techies, you should review the:", "choices": ["A.  Occupational safety and health issues", "B.  Business case", "C.  Potential suppliers on the prequalified sellers list", "D.  Cultural differences in the production workers"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. When managing risk, market factors that apply to the project should be included as an enterprise environmental factor. Market demand, a high risk, is included in the business case. A is incorrect because although you will comply with OSHA regulations in your new building, it is a low risk compared to no market for your gadgets. C is incorrect because the question does not imply the use of potential sellers. D is incorrect because resource risks are known risks and are mitigated later in the risk management processes."},
            {"id": 22, "quiz": "You have a team of 12 people who are working on various parts of a project whose purpose is to facilitate the buying and selling of big-box stores that have closed. You have a WBS, and now you are developing your scope baseline. Which of the following should you include in your project schedule?", "choices": ["A.  Schedule decomposition", "B.  Stakeholder issue tracking", "C.  Activities related to stakeholder engagement", "D.  A requirements traceability matrix"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The project schedule should include activities related to stakeholder engagement, risk mitigation, and project reviews. A is incorrect because the activities/tasks are already decomposed in a project schedule to work packages and then aggregated to build a project schedule. B is incorrect because stakeholder issues are listed in the stakeholder issue log. D is incorrect because a requirements traceability matrix is not included in a project schedule."},
            {"id": 23, "quiz": "On a buying and selling closed big-box stores project, you acknowledge the desire to control risk through planning and therefore conclude that your scope management approach should be:", "choices": ["A.  Predictive", "B.  Adaptive", "C.  Iterative", "D.  Lean"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. In a predictive (plan-driven) life cycle, the three major constraints (scope, schedule, and cost) are determined ahead of time, not just at a high level, but in detail. This is where the high-level planning is done for the entire project, but the detailed planning is done only for the work that needs to be done soon. In a plan-driven life cycle, the detailed scope of the project is determined right from the start. B and C are incorrect because the adaptive life cycle is based upon the iterative and incremental process models and focuses upon adaptability to changing product requirements and enhancing customer satisfaction through rapid delivery of working product features and client participation. D is incorrect because lean is also an adaptive life cycle approach and controls risk through rapid delivery of small amounts of working product."},
            {"id": 24, "quiz": "As you develop the project scope statement as the foundation for work your company is performing for a very demanding client, you should:", "choices": ["A.  Ask the project team to list the major deliverables to tie to major milestones", "B.  Identify any new job seekers for open positions", "C.  Use the resource traceability matrix in your data analysis", "D.  Include acceptance criteria to use as closure guidelines"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Acceptance criteria are documented in the project scope statement. Acceptance criteria are also considered an important part of contractual agreements on external projects and are used as project closure guidelines. A is incorrect because major deliverables are sometimes tied to major milestones and are displayed in a milestone chart, which is an output of developing the schedule. B is incorrect because new team members are added as part of acquiring the project team. C is incorrect because resource traceability matrix is a made-up term. A responsibility assignment matrix shows the project resources assigned to each work package."},
            {"id": 25, "quiz": "When you prepare your project schedule, you focus on identifying those activities that are on your critical path and that you intend to manage aggressively. As a part of the project schedule, it is also important for you to:", "choices": ["A.  Perform level-of-effort estimating for summary activities", "B.  Use the critical chain method to include buffers", "C.  Monitor the Iron Triangle for value and quality of the deliverables", "D.  Ensure each key stakeholder's project deliverable expectations are met"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Each stakeholder group has needs and expectations. Getting the right deliverables to the right stakeholders at the right time is paramount. A is incorrect because although prudent project managers use duration estimates for work package estimates and aggregate those estimates for summary activities, level of effort estimates are the number of labor hours required to complete an activity and therefore are not summaries. B is incorrect because the critical chain method of planning and managing projects emphasizes the resources (people, equipment, physical space) required to execute project tasks and therefore excludes buffers. C is incorrect because the Iron Triangle measures scope, time, and cost, not value and quality; however, the Agile Triangle measures value and quality in addition to Iron Triangle constraints."}
