        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "quiz": "Having been a PM for three years, you realize that a collective understanding of the success of the project among the project stakeholders can assist you in managing stakeholder expectations. Such a mutual understanding is best documented as part of the:", "choices": ["A.  Stakeholder management plan", "B.  Project scope statement", "C.  Scope management plan", "D.  Project charter"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The PM ensures that the context and framework of the project are properly defined, assessed, and documented in the form of a project scope statement. Project stakeholders should verify and approve the project scope statement. A is incorrect because the stakeholder management plan has been replaced with the stakeholder engagement plan. C is incorrect because the scope management plan is an input to defining the scope, which produces the project scope statement. D is incorrect because the project charter ensures a mutual understanding of deliverables and milestones."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "On your project, you prepared a detailed stakeholder analysis. Realizing there was not a mutual understanding of the project's direction, you should prepare a:", "choices": ["A.  Feasibility study", "B.  Stakeholder engagement plan", "C.  Governance plan", "D.  Project scope statement"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. The PM ensures that the context and framework of the project are properly defined, assessed, and documented in the form of a project scope statement. Project stakeholders should verify and approve the project scope statement. A is incorrect because a feasibility study is conducted as part of preproject work and is used to justify the project. B is incorrect because the stakeholder engagement plan identifies the project partnership\u2014shared accountability and responsibility\u2014a two-way engagement in project decision making and actions. C is incorrect because governance relates to managing change, which is not a natural follow-on to preparing a detailed stakeholder analysis."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "Because the WBS is used to capture all project and nonproject work, this means that project management office support deliverables should be considered a(n):", "choices": ["A.  Top-level milestone", "B.  External deliverable", "C.  Work package", "D.  Project management artifact"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The work to create project management office support deliverables is indeed work and therefore should be represented in the WBS as a work package. A work package is a group of related tasks within a project. Work packages are the smallest unit of work (typically 8 to 80 hours) that a project can be broken down to when creating your work breakdown structure (WBS). A is incorrect because a high-level milestone is a deliverable or major event to be achieved on a specified date. B is incorrect because an external deliverable is a product, service, or result delivered to a customer outside the company. D is incorrect because project management artifacts are created because of carrying out the work packages in a WBS (e.g., user stories, class diagrams, UML models)."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "In developing project scope, one approach is to:", "choices": ["A.  Describe scope in user stories", "B.  Determine scope through a high-level infrastructure", "C.  Use the project's budget to set a financial baseline", "D.  Include nonfunctional requirements for products, services, or results"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. User stories are an effective approach on all time-constrained projects and are a wonderful way to begin introducing a bit of agility to your projects and requirement management approach. In the adaptive approach, you are more likely to create a scope statement as project requirements in terms of user stories, as compared with a functional requirements document created as part of a predictive life cycle project. B is incorrect because the high-level infrastructure is determined as part of high-level design (HLD). Scope drives the design. C is incorrect because the project's budget is used to set a cost performance baseline. D is incorrect because nonfunctional requirements (speed, maintainability, robustness, etc.) are classified as solution requirements and are documented when collecting requirements."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "You are creating your WBS. You realize that a generally accepted business practice is to:", "choices": ["A.  Structure it so product scope and project scope are easily managed", "B.  Set it up so that it shows the complete scope of the work to be carried out on the project", "C.  Use it to define the management control points for each of the major deliverables", "D.  Define the solution to the problem in terms of a product, service, or result"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The WBS is the total scope of work to be done on the project\u2014what's in scope. A is incorrect because product scope is the features and functions of the product. Project scope is the work performed to deliver the product. The WBS provides the framework of what must be delivered. C is incorrect because management control points are normally key review points, such as end of design, or a major management review, such as after the release of the risk management plan. D is incorrect because the 'how' of the problem is left to the technical team after the business team has described the 'what' of the product, service, or result."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "Your organization's long-term goal is to build and sell electric bicycles. For now, your company will continue to produce motorcycles until the electric bicycles are online. You have a design team of 6 members and a production team of 18 people; these numbers are about half of what you believe you need. These limits are:", "choices": ["A.  Constraints to document in your project scope statement", "B.  Limitations to document in your project charter", "C.  Known risks to set aside management reserves", "D.  Key issues to document in the risk log"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. These are examples of constraints. Constraints and assumptions should be included in the scope statement. B is incorrect because resource limitations are not documented in the project charter. High-level boundaries are listed in the project charter. C is incorrect because contingency reserves are set aside for known risks. Unknown risks are covered by management reserves. Risks are documented in the risk register. D is incorrect because key issues are documented in the issues log."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "You are the PM on a high-priority project. Your company has limited human resources. You have been told that the completion date cannot change. You are developing the resource management plan. You have decided to:", "choices": ["A.  Prepare a resource plan", "B.  Use a resource breakdown structure linked to your WBS", "C.  Use resource smoothing", "D.  Conduct a Monte Carlo analysis to identify resource supply and demand on the project"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. A resource breakdown structure shows you the resources related by function/category and resource type. It can be decomposed to a level usable with the WBS to show the work to be performed, measured, and corrected. A is incorrect because the scope management plan is complete and you are still in the Planning process group. C is incorrect because resource smoothing is used when the schedule is top priority\u2014when the goal is to complete the work by the required date while avoiding the peaks and valleys of resource demand. It is a resource optimization technique used in schedule development (Executing process group). D is incorrect because Monte Carlo simulation uses randomness to solve problems. Limited human resources is a specific problem."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "You are in the military stationed near the North Pole. Your project is to rebuild all the runways at your air base, and you have one year to complete the project. Since it usually snows for nine months of the year, the construction team will be able to work on the runways in June, July, and August ... and maybe May and September. You understand your organizational culture, have the latest version of the scheduling software, and ESTICOR is used for standardized estimating data. What should you do now?", "choices": ["A.  You should prepare a scope management plan.", "B.  The agile release approach should be followed.", "C.  The critical path may change as you use resource leveling.", "D.  You should adjust the start and end times with leads and lags."], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The 'rebuild the runways' project is clearly defined, and the schedule management plan will show the scheduling methodology to be used. B is incorrect because the scope of the project is fully defined and it has a high degree of certainty. C is incorrect because you are in the execution phase and the scope management plan is complete. As you use resource leveling, it can cause the original critical path to change, especially if certain resources can only work at certain times. It is a resource optimization technique used in schedule development (Executing process group). D is incorrect because leads and lags are used to accelerate or delay activities. The weather is controlling the project, and the activities are finish-to-start."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "Your new project, the SecureAI Project, will view threats and security breaches of corporate data involving artificial intelligence (AI). You have a dedicated project team of 16 people. Maciej is the domain expert and is frequently used in expert systems software development. Maciej's expertise has been a major advantage so far on your project. To be prudent, you need to:", "choices": ["A.  Make sure there is a succession plan in place if Maciej leaves the project", "B.  Set up a process to debrief team members if they make plans to leave the project", "C.  Have everyone on your team go to advanced AI training", "D.  Have daily meetings with Maciej to make sure the project team knows what he is doing"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Most everyone on the project team will have some intellectual knowledge because of working on the project. A process is needed to capture Maciej's knowledge when he leaves the project. A is incorrect because a succession plan will identify who can replace Maciej. It will not solve the immediate problem of capturing and transferring his knowledge. C is incorrect because going to AI training is a good start and will help in the short term. D is incorrect because a daily meeting with Maciej will take away time from his work and is not practical for all team members to attend."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "You know that projects are unique endeavors, and you also know that they can be similar in some ways to other projects regarding work performance data and information. Which of the following will help ensure that project knowledge is a focus of your project team?", "choices": ["A.  A project management information system", "B.  A chief information officer on your dedicated team", "C.  A chief data management officer in the PMO", "D.  A detailed human resource information system"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. A PMIS, among other things, is helpful in sharing knowledge with the project team. It can include documents, data, and knowledge repositories. B is incorrect because a CIO is an executive-level position concerned with IT strategies and tactics, not day-to-day project management. C is incorrect because chief data management officer is a made-up job title. D is incorrect because a human resources system is not focused on project data."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "As you manage the SecureAI Project, you know you will encounter some risks and issues. Issues can be risks that have occurred, but also are areas of concern to the project. A generally accepted business practice to follow regarding risks and issues is to:", "choices": ["A.  Use the risk register to capture operational-level issues", "B.  Set up a risk control board for risks and issues that may occur", "C.  Set up an escalation process for you to help resolve risks and issues", "D.  Ensure a risk or issue is isolated to a singular project phase"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Risks or issues related to project objectives, resource and intergroup conflicts, ambiguous roles and responsibilities, scope disagreements, and third-party dependencies are some known situations calling for escalations. Such issues require higher-level intervention because many times the authority, decision making, resources, or effort required to resolve them are beyond a project manager's scope. A is incorrect because issues are recorded in the issues log, not the risk register. B is incorrect because although there is a change control board, there is not a separate risk control board, as risks are evaluated by the change control board during an impact assessment. D is incorrect because the risk management processes identify risks by category and select risk strategies to address overall risk exposure throughout the project, including when risks and issues span project phases."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "In your project to set up a new production line for innovative gadget gifts for techies, you have decided to use two contractor companies for the work: one for the software and one for the hardware. You have developed the procurement management plan, and you have created a WBS. You recently met with the software contract officer and she had an issue to discuss with you, and in thinking about it, you realized it also affected the hardware contractor team. You should immediately:", "choices": ["A.  Meet with the entire project team.", "B.  Inform your executive sponsor of this issue.", "C.  Escalate it to the steering committee for resolution.", "D.  Analyze your response so it is consistent with project objectives."], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. When you resolve an issue, you need to determine a course of action that is consistent with the project's objectives to achieve project benefits and deliver business value. A is incorrect because the issue is with the software contractor and may affect the hardware contractor. This is an issue resolution meeting and should include the appropriate stakeholders involved. The whole team may not be affected by the topics addressed and does not need to attend the meeting. Perhaps any team member who has a defined role in the meeting could attend. B is incorrect because the PM is responsible for conflict resolution. If the disruptive conflict continues, formal procedures (escalation) and disciplinary actions can be used. C is incorrect because the project manager is responsible for conflict resolution. If the disruptive conflict continues, formal procedures (escalation) and disciplinary actions can be used."},
            {"id": 13, "quiz": "You just graduated from a prestigious university and you have been appointed to your first job as a project manager. Your project charter has been approved, and you now have a dedicated team who is working with you in planning the project. So far, you have prepared your scope and quality management plans and now are beginning to work on other plans that will be included in your project management plan. In the project management plan, you need to describe how performance reports will be prepared and distributed. Your program manager pointed out that she wanted regular updates, but she did not want to see many metrics collected that did not add value. You and your team have decided that the best approach is to choose metrics that:", "choices": ["A.  Show how your project contributes to the organization's bottom line", "B.  Show the progress according to the triple constraints", "C.  Use earned value management to assess project performance and progress", "D.  Show project management and team delivery rates"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Key performance indicators (KPIs) should measure how the project contributes to tangible and intangible, as well as internal and external, benefits, such as profitability, goodwill, loyalty, etc. B is incorrect because reaching a reasonable trade-off among the three project constraints does not necessarily mean that the project is delivering business value. C is incorrect because EVM is used at the project level and does not show the direct and indirect measurements used to show the benefits (business value) realized. D is incorrect because there is no indication in the answer of what is being measured for project management or team delivery."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "You must develop a scope statement for a cross-department project. Many people will be involved in this project with multiple stakeholders represented from each of the departments. In this case, who would approve the scope statement that you develop?", "choices": ["A.  The project team members", "B.  The project sponsor", "C.  The project manager", "D.  The financial manager"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The project sponsors or initiators drive the business need for the project, and they approve the project scope statement. A is incorrect because although project team members may provide input to the project scope statement, they are not approvers. C is incorrect because the project manager has created the project scope statement and must seek approval from the project sponsor. D is incorrect because although the financial manager has input to creating the scope statement, approving their own input would be inappropriate."},
            {"id": 15, "quiz": "A project manager is stepping in as a take-over role and has been given a completed project scope statement prepared by the previous project manager. What is the first action she should take at this point?", "choices": ["A.  Create a complete network diagram for the tasks and milestones in the project.", "B.  Confirm that the project management team agrees with the scope statement.", "C.  Develop a detailed project plan based on the existing work breakdown structure.", "D.  Call a meeting of the project management team to agree on a procurement plan."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The project management team is responsible for taking the project charter and creating a scope statement. They are included in the set of all project stakeholders. It is important that all stakeholders have had input to the project scope statement and there is consensus before doing anything else. A is incorrect because she has not verified the project scope statement and therefore cannot continue forward to planning the work. C is incorrect because the WBS may not align to the project scope statement. D is incorrect because developing a procurement plan would be premature without a valid scope statement and WBS."},
            {"id": 16, "quiz": "You have just acquired a new team member on the project you are managing. This is the first project for the team member, and she asks you the purpose of the WBS. What do you describe as its primary purpose?", "choices": ["A.  Clarify the responsibility for project tasks.", "B.  Communicate with all stakeholders.", "C.  Define the business need for the project.", "D.  Detail the dates for the work packages."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The WBS serves as a communication mechanism to and from project stakeholders. A is incorrect because the WBS does not show responsibilities for tasks. C is incorrect because the business need is defined in the project charter. D is incorrect because dates are decided based on more detailed schedule planning."},
            {"id": 17, "quiz": "The project has produced a requirements traceability matrix that links requirements to their origin and traces them throughout the project life cycle. Which statement describes the purpose of the requirements traceability matrix?", "choices": ["A.  It describes in detail the project's deliverables and the work required to create those deliverables and includes product and project scope description.", "B.  It ensures that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at the end of the project and helps manage changes to the product scope.", "C.  It is a narrative description of products or services to be delivered by the project and is received from the customer for external projects.", "D.  It provides the necessary information from a business standpoint to determine whether the project is worth the required investment."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The requirements traceability matrix ensures that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at the end of the project. The requirements traceability matrix also provides a structure for managing changes to product scope. A is incorrect because it describes the project scope statement. C is incorrect because this is the project statement of work used in developing the project charter. D is incorrect because it describes the project business case. Identifying all stakeholders is the only way to uncover all project requirements."},
            {"id": 18, "quiz": "You have been developing a scope statement for a project you have been given authority to manage. During this process, you came across areas of technical details that you were not familiar with. Which of the following would you use to help clarify the related issues and their impact on the project scope?", "choices": ["A.  Experienced managers", "B.  Special interest groups", "C.  Expert judgment", "D.  Similar project plans"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The use of expert judgment is recommended when a project manager comes across an area that is unfamiliar. A is incorrect because 'experienced managers' is not a clear answer. B and D are incorrect because special interest groups (SIGs) are a possibility, as are similar project plans, but expert judgment is considered the best answer because of the technical detail that can be provided by a subject matter expert."},
            {"id": 19, "quiz": "You have been given the responsibility for a project that you have not been involved with to date. The project is at the beginning of the execution stage. What is the main document to which you would refer to guide you on what you should be doing on this project?", "choices": ["A.  Project management plan", "B.  Procurement management plan", "C.  Communication management plan", "D.  Project scope management plan"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The project management plan is the main reference for the project manager during the execution stage of a project. B, C, and D are incorrect because the procurement management plan, communications management plan, and project scope management plan are all subsets of the project management plan."},
            {"id": 20, "quiz": "You are involved in a project and regularly receive work packages to complete from the project manager. The project manager describes some of the results of your work as project deliverables. The processes that describe project deliverables from your work are defined in which of the following?", "choices": ["A.  The completed task contract form", "B.  The initial work breakdown structure", "C.  The project management plan", "D.  The initial project scope document"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Deliverables are produced as outputs from the processes described in the project management plan. A is incorrect because not all tasks produce project deliverables and are not tracked with a task contract. B is incorrect because not all WBS elements produce project deliverables. D is incorrect because the initial project scope document does not list project deliverables."},
            {"id": 21, "quiz": "The project has produced a requirements management plan. What is the purpose of this document?", "choices": ["A.  The requirements management plan links requirements to their origin and traces them throughout the project.", "B.  The requirements management plan documents how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed throughout the project.", "C.  The requirements management plan describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project.", "D.  The requirements management plan provides guidance on how project scope will be defined, documented, verified, managed, and controlled."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The requirements management plan documents how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed throughout the project. A is incorrect because it is the definition of the requirements traceability matrix. C is incorrect because it describes the requirements document. D is incorrect because it describes the scope management plan."},
            {"id": 22, "quiz": "You are discussing your role as a project manager with your peers. In the conversation, another team member describes the process of defining and controlling what is, and what is not, included in the project. What are these activities called?", "choices": ["A.  Project documentation management", "B.  Project change control", "C.  Plan scope management", "D.  Formal acceptance documents"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The Plan Scope Management process defines and controls what is, and what is not, included in the project. A and B are incorrect because project documentation management and project change control are procedures to allow the control of changes to scope only. D is incorrect because formal acceptance documents are part of the Close Project or Phase process."},
            {"id": 23, "quiz": "You have been involved in a workshop at which the project management team created an initial work breakdown structure (WBS). Which of the following best describes the process in which you were involved?", "choices": ["A.  Calculating the total duration of the project from the start", "B.  Counting the total number of work packages in the project", "C.  Allocating responsibilities for the project work to individuals in the team", "D.  Subdividing the project work into smaller, more manageable components"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. The Create WBS process subdivides the major project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable components. A is incorrect because the WBS does not concern project duration. B is incorrect because determining the total work package count is not a function of the Create WBS process. C is incorrect because the allocation of responsibilities is not a function of the initial WBS."},
            {"id": 24, "quiz": "The scope management plan is produced by the project management team as part of the Plan Scope Management process. Which statement best describes the scope management plan?", "choices": ["A.

The scope management plan documents how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed throughout the project.", "C.  The scope management plan describes in detail the project's deliverables and the work required to create those deliverables.", "D.  The scope management plan is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team."], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The scope management plan provides guidance on how project scope will be defined, documented, verified, managed, and controlled. It may be formal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed, based on the project needs. B is incorrect because detailed requirements are not part of a project charter.
