The project scope management plan", "C.  The project management plan", "D.  The quality management plan"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The Close Project or Phase process is defined within the project management plan. A, B, and D are incorrect because the procurement, scope, and quality management plans are specific plans for each of these areas and do not specify the Close Project or Phase process."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "You are responsible for the Close Project or Phase process on a large project. You are asked to report the activities you are performing. These activities include defining how the project will transfer the services produced to the operational division of the organization. What term describes these activities?", "choices": ["A.  Contract closure", "B.  The project management plan", "C.  Administrative closure", "D.  Deliverable acceptance"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The term for reporting activities in the Close Project or Phase process is administrative closure. This includes methodologies for how the project will transfer the services produced to the operational division of the organization. A is incorrect because contract closure is not concerned with transfer to operations. B is incorrect because the project management plan is the superset of these procedures. D is incorrect because deliverable acceptance is not part of the Close Project or Phase process."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "You have been managing a project for some time and have been asked to identify the current stage of the project. You are reviewing a document that formally indicates that the sponsor has officially accepted the project deliverables. Which document are you reviewing?", "choices": ["A.  Administrative closure documents", "B.  Contract closure documents", "C.  Project closure documents", "D.  Organizational process assets"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C.

Holding a preliminary meeting with those involved in your project to plan the closure meeting"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C.

B is incorrect because you cannot shut down the contractors until you have formalized the completion of the contracts. D is incorrect because it is not prudent to have a meeting to discuss the next meeting. We only meet when needed, and we follow meeting type guidelines."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "As the 2nd Avenue subway project comes to a close, as the project manager, you need to associate a time frame with the realization of benefits.

It is important that project managers keep the benefits of the project clearly in mind by demonstrating realization of the benefits by phases for short-term, long-term, and ongoing benefits. B is incorrect because the project benefits management plan describes when the benefits of the project will be delivered. C is incorrect because the transition of the subway project from implementation to ongoing operations is part of the Close Project or Phase process. D is incorrect because you have shown the stakeholders project deliverables throughout the life cycle."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "Unfortunately, your project to develop the next generation of electric bicycles was canceled because a competitor released its product before your project was scheduled to be complete.

Document the current state of contractual obligations.", "B.  Focus on the lessons learned from this project.", "C.  Show the scope of work that was completed.", "D.  Decide to dispose of all resources."], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Documenting the current state of contractual obligations as described in the project closure guidelines is the next thing to do.

C and D are incorrect because the procurement management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The procurement management plan may be updated with seller performance data in the Control Procurements process."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "You are concerned that all the contracted deliverables on your project may not be complete though the contractor has submitted a final payment request.

If you are concerned that all the deliverables from a contractor may not be complete, you need to note any unaccounted variations and deviations for follow-up activities. A is incorrect because common reasons for terminating a contract include unsatisfactory performance of the whole or part of the contract by the other party. We cannot be sure we have *just cause* to terminate based on our concerns. C is incorrect because your budget, the approved estimate for the project, has already been determined. The cost baseline could change to include contingency reserves for the incomplete deliverables. D is incorrect because we need more details about our *concerns* and the project management team would be notified after the project sponsor, a key stakeholder."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "Because your budget and accounting systems are not integrated with your project management information system, it is difficult to relate expenditures, especially between different project phases.

Implement the Close Project or Phase process.", "D.  Return the remaining budget to the accounting department for reallocation."], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The Close Project or Phase process is performed even if the project is terminated before objectives are met. Close Project activities must also be performed at the end of each phase to satisfy the exit criteria from the prior phase and to justify proceeding to the next phase. At project end, the Close Project process administers the transfer of the project deliverable(s) to production and/or operations. Furthermore, lessons learned are gathered throughout the project phases; however, these will be documented, analyzed, and archived within the knowledge base, part of Organizational Process Assets, during the Close Project process for use by future projects or phases. A is incorrect because releasing the team is a part of Close Project or Phase. B is incorrect because, like A, it is a part of Close Project or Phase.

            {"id": 26, "quiz": "Your agile project team has successfully demonstrated the final deliverable of a year-long project. Your CIO is sold on the iterative/adaptive approach.

Confirm data analysis techniques used in the project.", "D.  Control quality."], "ans": 1, "reason": " A.

B is incorrect because reassigning the project staff should be one of the last activities in the Close Project or Phase process. You may need them to help with writing the final report. C is incorrect because the final report is not part of organizational process assets updates. The best answer is to write the final report first, with help from the project team, and then update documents and the lessons learned repository. D is incorrect because Control Quality, which ensures the deliverables meet stakeholder acceptance, is accomplished before the Close Project or Phase process."},

See if another project needs a senior project manager."], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. If a project is terminated prior to completion, you are to document the reason for early termination and transition the complete and incomplete deliverables to production/support/operations. B is incorrect because sunk cost is money that has already been spent and cannot be recovered. Logic dictates that because sunk costs will not change\u2014no matter what actions are taken\u2014they should not play a role in decision making. C is incorrect because you will release resources after you perform the activities in the Close Project or Phase process. D is incorrect because yes, after you complete answers A and C, it will be time to have a look around the company for another assignment."},

A is incorrect because the best way to provide honest and encouraging feedback is through face-to-face communication. B is incorrect because lessons learned from a previous project may not help with the current quality concerns. C is incorrect because sending out a survey and then organizing a focus group will take too much time. Try to solve the quality issues now."}
