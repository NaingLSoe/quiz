        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "quiz": "You have been asked to create an end-to-end manufacturing process for your company's next-generation semiconductor fabrication line. This new fabrication line is time critical, and industry competition is fierce. Many of the older employees who have traditionally worked on the fabrication lines have helped the company be successful using ad hoc processes and heuristic knowledge. As the project manager, you want to use comprehensive project management best practices wherever possible to maximize the chances of success. Which of the following would you do first?", "choices": ["A.  Calculate the project timeline and initial budget", "B.  Recruit the key project skills as early as possible", "C.  Develop the project charter and scope of work", "D.  Write a comprehensive change control process"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. A project charter with a well-defined scope of work is necessary to calculating timelines, calculating budgets, recruiting skills, and creating a change management process. The development of the project charter is part of the project initiation process. A, B, and D are incorrect because they are part of scope control and detailed planning, which follow project charter creation. A is incorrect because a project timeline and budget cannot be created without knowing what is in scope for the project. B is incorrect and should be undertaken as early as possible, but skills cannot be determined until the scope of the effort is determined. D is incorrect because the timing for a change control process is after an understanding of the scope of the effort is complete."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "You've just joined the company as a project manager for a new project. You've worked on projects at your prior company and are looking to ensure that you have the authority needed to carry out your roles and responsibilities. Which project document should you ask to see first?", "choices": ["A.  Work breakdown structure", "B.  Project charter", "C.  Requirements document", "D.  Project schedule"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project and gives the project manager the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. A project manager is identified and assigned as early in the project as is feasible. The project manager should always be assigned prior to the start of planning, and preferably while the project charter is being developed. Without an approved charter, the project manager has no authority within the organization. A and D are incorrect because they are a part of the project plan, which follows from a project's charter. The work breakdown structure (WBS) itemizes the work to be done in the project. The project schedule aligns the work to be done with a calendar for completion. C is incorrect because a requirements document is created as a part of the executing phase and details the product planned to be created by the project charter."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "You are developing the project charter for a project for an external customer. To complete the project charter, which of the following should be in place?", "choices": ["A.  The detailed features list to be delivered", "B.  The not-to-exceed price for the project", "C.  The agreed-upon contract for the project", "D.  The estimated labor costs of the project"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The project charter inputs may include the contract if the project is being done for an external customer. The other options are all subsets of an agreed-upon contract or calculations that lead to an agreed-upon contract. A is incorrect because only a high-level list of features is created at the project charter point. B is incorrect because the not-to-exceed detail may be a component of the contract with the external organization; however, not all contracts have a not-to-exceed component. D is incorrect because although labor costs may have been estimated to arrive at pricing, those costs would be a variable used in calculating the contract price."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "As a project manager, you have been given a statement of work for a project you are assigned to manage. This project is internal to your organization. Who will have provided you with this statement of work?", "choices": ["A.  The end-user group", "B.  Your line manager", "C.  The project director", "D.  The project sponsor"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. The project statement of work (SOW) is provided by the project initiator or sponsor for internal projects based on a business need, product, or service requirement. A is incorrect because the end-user group represents the stakeholders who will ultimately use the product of the project on an ongoing basis; this group may have input to the product that is needed, but would not provide the final statement of work. B is incorrect as it implies a matrix management organization, and in that situation the line manager is responsible for your career, not your project. C is incorrect because there is no project role called 'project director' (in the financial industry there are often managing directors, but those still are not project managers)."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "You have been given a brief time to write a project charter for a project that has been fast tracked. The project will develop an IT system to help the sales team close external leads. Which of the following would be least likely to help you clarify the influences on the project when writing the project charter?", "choices": ["A.  Existing skills and knowledge within the organization", "B.  Regulatory standards that are about to be approved", "C.  The infrastructure in place to support an IT solution", "D.  The likely political changes in local government"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. As a project manager, you must consider many factors when developing a project charter; however, external political changes will have the least impact on an internal software solution being developed by your own company. A is incorrect because it is important to know the existing skills and knowledge within the organization when resourcing the project and that will be dealt with after the project charter is written and hopefully approved. B is incorrect because both existing and pending regulatory changes can directly influence the scope and efforts of the project. C is incorrect because the existing infrastructure in use by IT is extremely important, given that the solution will be developed in-house."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "The project charter you have developed has not yet been approved by the project sponsor though you submitted it two weeks ago. Your direct line manager insists that you start work on the project immediately because he needs you on another project in a few months' time. What is the best course of action for you?", "choices": ["A.  Start interviewing potential team members in anticipation of project approval", "B.  Start working on the project plan as a work in progress", "C.  State the likely impact of proceeding without approval", "D.  Negotiate a compromise with the line manager that considers the next project"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. As a project manager you must not start a project without an approved charter. If the project starts without approval, organizational resources may be misdirected or wasted and rework may be created. Your authority to proceed should be given by the ultimate authority: the project sponsor. A is incorrect, as it would let people know about a project that has not yet been authorized, and in the world of dealing with the emotions of team members, it might get someone's hopes up falsely. B is incorrect because a project plan follows a project charter; the project plan requires the authority to manage the project, and said authority has not yet been acquired. D is incorrect, although an interesting answer\u2014recall that the line manager's job and your project manager's job have two different goals and you need to be true to the goal of the project."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "The project you have been asked to develop a charter for is complex and has many inputs that are beyond your direct knowledge. Which of the following tools and techniques would best help you proceed with the project chartering process?", "choices": ["A.  Matrix management structure", "B.  Available project templates", "C.  Lessons learned", "D.  Expert judgment of others"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. When developing a project charter, the input of expert judgment often is used to help identify the inputs that must be considered in this process. A is incorrect because a matrix management structure involves the line or direct managers, who would not have knowledge of the inputs needed for your project. B is incorrect because this may be helpful, but templates in and of themselves are skeletons of documents without specific reference to inputs you may need. C is incorrect because lessons learned do come from prior projects, but asking experts should be a first choice."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "You have been asked to analyze a project charter that has been developed by another part of your business. Which of the following would you consider essential for the project charter to be approved?", "choices": ["A.  Detailed work and schedule estimates", "B.  A list of all the resources required", "C.  The business need for the project", "D.  A list of all the risks in the project"], "ans": 4, "reason": " C. The business need for the project is an essential input to the project charter. The detailed estimates and lists of risks are produced as part of project planning, which comes after the project chartering process. Some general and top-level resources are included in the project charter, but not all the resources for the project. A is incorrect because detailed work and schedule estimates are developed during the planning phase of a project. B is incorrect because the detailed resources required will not be known until the full set of requirements is developed. D is incorrect because of the word 'all.' Risks are important, but the only risks identified at the initiating project charter stage are high-level risks\u2014product risks come later."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "You have been provided a document that contains the market demand and cost-benefit analysis that justifies the go-ahead for the project. What is this document called?", "choices": ["A.  Contract", "B.  Statement of work", "C.  Business case", "D.  Organizational asset"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The business case contains the business need and cost-benefit analysis that justify the go-ahead of the project; it is created because of market demand, organizational need, customer request, technological advance, or legal requirement. All other options are inputs to the process of developing a project charter. A is incorrect because a contract implies an external entity involved with your own company, therefore, a contract would not contain cost-benefit information. B is incorrect because a statement of work (SOW) identifies all the deliverables for the project without regard for cost-benefit analysis. D is incorrect because an organizational process asset references the templates for documents used within an organization and may include policies and process references as well."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "You are preparing an initial stakeholder list for a project to replace the company's email system, and you believe your list is too short and is therefore likely not complete. To ensure that you take a comprehensive approach to identifying stakeholders, you decide to seek the expert judgment of this stakeholder:", "choices": ["A.  Data base architect", "B.  Resource allocation manager", "C.  Competitors", "D.  Project sponsor"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. As part of stakeholder analysis, groups or individuals, such as senior management, project sponsor, project team, industry groups, and even technical or professional associations, should contribute to the process. A is incorrect because the data base architect may not be a member of the project team. B is incorrect because the resource allocation manager's job is to supply project resources as they are needed. C is incorrect because competitors are not a source of identifying stakeholders for an internal project, though they may be a stakeholder group that should be analyzed during the project."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "Which of the following is an output of the Identify Stakeholders process?", "choices": ["A.  Stakeholder register", "B.  Enterprise environmental factors", "C.  Change control process", "D.  Communication models"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The stakeholder register is a project document that lists identified stakeholders, including name, organizational position, location, contact details, and project role. The stakeholder register is a repository for storing assessments about each stakeholder group, including major requirements, expectations, potential for influencing project outcomes, and the phase of the project the stakeholder will likely participate in or influence. The stakeholder classification may also be useful to the project manager, and a variety of classifications can be decided for each project (e.g., internal/external). B is incorrect because enterprise environmental factors are influences on a project and serve as an input to the plan stakeholder engagement process and are not an output of identify stakeholders. C is incorrect because although a change control process is used by stakeholders, it does not provide information that assists in the process of identifying stakeholders. D is incorrect because deciding on communications models requires that stakeholders already be identified."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "The project statement of work that includes the business needs and high-level product requirements for the new hydroelectric plant has just been agreed to and completed. Which deliverable should be created next for this project?", "choices": ["A.  Scope statement", "B.  Management plan", "C.  Charter", "D.  Requirements document"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. With the business need identified and high-level deliverables defined in the statement of work (SOW), the project charter is created next to give the project manager the authority to work on the project and create the product deliverables. A, B, and D are incorrect because each is an output of the planning phase, which follows the initiation phase. If the project charter does not exist, the project manager has no mandate to create the scope statement, management plan, or requirements document."},
            {"id": 13, "quiz": "At which point in a project should the project manager ensure that the organizational process assets are first available?", "choices": ["A.  At the end of the Initiating process group", "B.  Before the Initiating process group starts", "C.  During the Planning process group", "D.  At the end of the Planning process group"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Business documents, agreements, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets are all inputs to the Develop Project Charter process. A is incorrect because organizational process assets are an input needed to help develop the project charter and are therefore needed before, not at the end, of the initiating process group. C and D are incorrect because the organizational assets must be present for the project charter to be created, which happens before the planning process group, not during or at the end."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "Project sponsors have the most influence on the scope, quality, time, and cost of the project during:", "choices": ["A.  Initiating", "B.  Planning", "C.  Executing", "D.  Closing"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The project sponsor is the key stakeholder in the initiating phase. The project charter is agreed to by the project sponsor and represents what they want out of the project; it also drives the direction of the project. B is incorrect because the project manager, not the sponsor, has the greatest influence during the planning phase. C is incorrect because the execution phase is carrying out what has been agreed on in the project charter during initiation and in the project plan during planning. Although there may be updates to the project plan during execution, any changes are affecting the original scope, quality, time, and cost variables and are not brand new therefore less influential in this phase. D is incorrect because at closing the project deliverables have been created and scope, quality, schedule, and cost are now actuals that can no longer be influenced."},
            {"id": 15, "quiz": "Which of the following is an output of the Identify Stakeholders process?", "choices": ["A.  Stakeholder register", "B.  RACI chart", "C.  Stakeholder management strategies", "D.  Stakeholder engagement"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. This is the primary output of the Identify Stakeholders process together with updates to the project management plan and project documents. Change requests are also an output of the Identify Stakeholders process. B is incorrect because the RACI chart identifies roles and responsibilities but is not an output of Identify Stakeholders. C is incorrect because stakeholder management strategies are part of the stakeholder management plan. D is incorrect because the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process uses the stakeholder register as an input."},
            {"id": 16, "quiz": "A key stakeholder is complaining to several of your project team members about the ineffectiveness of some of the risk responses. This is having a negative impact on team morale. What is the best method for handling this situation?", "choices": ["A.  Arrange to meet with the stakeholder to clarify any concerns", "B.  Arrange for team-building activities to get the team back on track", "C.  Report the stakeholder to the project sponsor so she can handle the situation and allow you to focus on the project", "D.  Report the stakeholder's conduct to the stakeholder's senior management"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Arranging to meet and clarify the stakeholders confronts the situation where efforts can be made to create a win-win arrangement. This deals with the problem directly and is the recommended method. A project manager's first response should be directly with the stakeholder to understand the root cause of the concerns as a precursor to resolving the issue. B is incorrect because it does not address the root cause (stakeholder's complaint). C is incorrect because it is the project manager's job to solve project problems; problems that cannot be solved by the project manager should be escalated to the project sponsor, but escalating is not a first response. D is incorrect because the stakeholder's management chain should not be a project manager's first response."},
            {"id": 17, "quiz": "You are a newly hired project manager working on your first project at a law firm with the goal of upgrading information security. The two managing partners at the law firm are used to getting their way and are pressuring you to meet only their needs and not to involve the remaining 30 lawyers in the project. How will the Identify Stakeholders process assist you with the task?", "choices": ["A.  Planning how you will control stakeholders and their impact throughout the project", "B.  Establishing an approach to increase the support and minimize opposition of stakeholders", "C.  Creating a systematic approach to identifying stakeholders", "D.  Setting the tone for document creation to be used on the project"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Stakeholder analysis is performed during the Identify Stakeholders process to define strategies to promote stakeholder engagement. It includes key stakeholders and their impact/influence, level of participation, and stakeholder groups. A is incorrect because the goal is not to control stakeholders. C is incorrect because the stakeholders should have already been identified; however, new ones may be added. D is incorrect because the stakeholder management strategy information is too sensitive to share."},
            {"id": 18, "quiz": "You are collecting and examining qualitative and quantitative information to ascertain whose interests should be considered throughout the project. In which activity are you engaging?", "choices": ["A.  Stakeholder analysis", "B.  Communications planning", "C.  Risk analysis", "D.  Organizational structure analysis"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Stakeholder analysis focuses on stakeholder interests, influence, knowledge, etc., to determine the best approach to effectively engage them in project decisions and activities. B is incorrect because although communications planning is important when interacting with stakeholders, it is not relevant in the context of identifying stakeholders. C is incorrect because risk analysis uses qualitative and quantitative information to determine probability, impact, and numerical values for risks, not stakeholder identification. D is incorrect because there is no technique called organizational structure analysis."},
            {"id": 19, "quiz": "You work for a large organization that offers risk management, quality management, and change management consulting services to other companies. Recent projects have produced disappointing results; therefore, the organization has added you to the steering committee to assist the solution search. One agreement reached is that future projects will be selected based on financial measures such as return on investment (ROI), payback period, internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV). Four such projects are currently under investigation and have the following details: Project A has an ROI of $80,000, Project B has an ROI of $85K, Project C has an ROI of $78K, and Project D has an ROI of $82K. Based on this information, which project would you select?", "choices": ["A.  Project A", "B.  Project B", "C.  Project C", "D.  Project D"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Project selection is based on ROI, so the project returning the largest investment should be chosen, which is Project B at $85,000. A, C, and D are incorrect because the ROI values for these projects are all lower than $85,000."},
            {"id": 20, "quiz": "What document formally authorizes a project?", "choices": ["A.  Business case", "B.  Project charter", "C.  Project statement of work (SOW)", "D.  Project management plan"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The Develop Project Charter process assigns the project manager and produces the project charter that officially authorizes the project. A is incorrect because the business case explains the need for the project. C is incorrect because the SOW, part of the agreements, is a written description of the project's product, service, or result. The business case and agreements serve as inputs to the Develop Project Charter process. D is incorrect because the project management plan is developed after the project charter is approved and the project manager is assigned."},
            {"id": 21, "quiz": "Select the process that assigns the project manager to a project.", "choices": ["A.  Develop Project Charter", "B.  Develop Project Management Plan", "C.  Develop Business Case", "D.  Develop Strategic Plan"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The Develop Project Charter process assigns the project manager and produces the project charter that authorizes the project and links the need for the project to the organization's strategic plan. B is incorrect because the project management plan is created by the project manager in the planning phase. C is incorrect because it is a made-up process name; the business case provides the strategic and financial justification for the project and therefore precedes the project charter. D is incorrect because it is a made-up process name; the strategic plan precedes the project charter."},
            {"id": 22, "quiz": "You are part of an expert committee deciding which project should be implemented by your company. Your committee asks tough questions and helps decide which projects your company should select. Only the worthiest projects get through the tough scrutiny. Which project selection technique is being used?", "choices": ["A.  Scoring model", "B.  PMO selection", "C.  Murder board", "D.  Defined benefit"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. A murder board is a process where a committee asks questions from project representatives as part of the project selection process to shoot down and eliminate projects that are not of the highest value to the company. From Wikipedia, 'A murder board, also known as a 'scrub-down,' is a committee of questioners set up to critically review a proposal and/or help someone prepare for a difficult oral examination.' A is incorrect because it is a method for ranking projects that does not involve oral questions. B is incorrect because the murder board may or may not be associated with a PMO. D is incorrect because no defined benefit threshold is mentioned in the question as a criterion for project selection."},
            {"id": 23, "quiz": "Which two knowledge areas are involved in the Initiating process group?", "choices": ["A.  Project Integration Management and Project Scope Management", "B.  Project Scope Management and Project Schedule Management", "C.  Project Integration Management and Project Stakeholder Management", "D.  Project Scope Management and Project Risk Management"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The knowledge area Project Integration Management contains the Develop Project Charter process, and the Project Stakeholder Management process contains Identify Stakeholders. A is incorrect because Project Scope Management has no processes in the Initiating process group. B is incorrect because neither Project Scope Management nor Project Schedule Management have processes in the Initiating process group. D is incorrect because Project Risk Management has no processes in the Initiating process group."},
            {"id": 24, "quiz": "Which project role is generally accountable for the development and maintenance of the business case associated with a project?", "choices": ["A.  Project sponsor", "B.  Project manager", "C.  Business stakeholder", "D.  IT stakeholder"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The project sponsor is responsible for funding the project and ensuring that it takes place. A business analyst may assist in writing the business case, but the project sponsor is accountable for the deliverable. B is incorrect because the business case precedes the project charter, which links a project manager to a project. C and D are incorrect because although either may be in the role of project sponsor, in which case they would be responsible, this would only be in the role of business or IT stakeholder\u2014there is no power to authorize a project."},
            {"id": 25, "quiz": "Expert judgment is a tool and technique of which process?", "choices": ["A.  Identify Resources", "B.  Monitor Stakeholder Engagement", "C.  Manage Stakeholder Engagement", "D.  Manage Stakeholder Management"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Expert judgment is a tool and technique of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. A and D are incorrect because they are distracters\u2014the terms are made-up. B is incorrect because Monitor Stakeholder Engagement does not use expert judgment."},
