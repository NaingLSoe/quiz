        "questions": [
            {"id": 1, "quiz": "The project you are working on is running behind schedule, is over budget, and is failing to deliver the features originally promised. The project manager says that the work must now be focused on a list of activities. What defines this list of activities?", "choices": ["A.  Shortest-duration tasks", "B.  Requirements documentation", "C.  Critical-path tasks", "D.  Lowest-cost tasks"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The requirements documentation helps define the priorities of the requirements as part of the Collect Requirements process. This is where the project team determines how resources can be best used to obtain contract acceptance. A is incorrect because shortest-duration tasks will give an impression of progress, but that focus may be on the wrong tasks. C is incorrect because focusing on critical-path tasks will preserve or shorten the duration but may not ensure meeting the overall contract. D is incorrect because focusing on lowest-cost tasks will help short-term cash flow but may not meet the contract or stakeholders' expectations."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "You are assigned to manage a new project. Your line manager suggests that you should use a tool to help you plan the new project. She suggests that you use a work breakdown structure (WBS) template. Which of the following is the best description of this tool?", "choices": ["A.  A document that lists WBS elements", "B.  An all-purpose WBS from the Internet", "C.  A WBS from a previous project", "D.  A definition of WBS colors and shapes"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. A work breakdown template is often a WBS from a previous project within your organization, because projects within an organization often share many common elements and processes. A and B are incorrect because generic or general-purpose lists of elements or structures are not necessarily the best fit for your organization. D is incorrect because WBS colors and shapes are cosmetic definitions of standards to be referenced."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "The project meeting you are attending is becoming heated, and arguments are starting about the work completed and the work to be done. The project manager stops the discussion and refers to one document that is used as a reference. What is this document called?", "choices": ["A.  Approved changes", "B.  Newly identified risks", "C.  The WBS template", "D.  The scope baseline"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. The work to be done in a project is defined in the WBS and is part of the approved project scope statement and associated WBS. This is known as the scope baseline. A is incorrect because approved changes are only one part of the scope. B is incorrect because newly identified risks are not necessarily translated to impact on the work or scope. C is incorrect because the WBS template is a generic starting point for defining the scope or final WBS."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "After some changes to your project scope, you have revised the schedule, costs, and work package assignments, and these changes have been approved. What action do you now complete?", "choices": ["A.  Wait for resources to complete current assignments.", "B.  Reissue the project management plan.", "C.  Immediately look for other changes to submit.", "D.  Let the project schedule continue as previously."], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Reissuing the project management plan is a major output of controlling scope once the changes have been approved. A is incorrect because some assignments may have to be changed. C is incorrect because looking for other changes without issuing the new plan may cause rework. D is incorrect because letting the project schedule continue and ignoring the recent changes may compromise the project."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "You have asked a team member to perform many actions on a project plan. These actions are decomposing the work packages into smaller components and activities that are to be the basis for estimating, scheduling, and running the project. What is this team member's activity called?", "choices": ["A.  Schedule work", "B.  Estimate tasks", "C.  Schedule activities", "D.  Define activities"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. As part of the Project Schedule Management knowledge area, the project manager must define activities, which allows for decomposing the work packages into smaller components and activities that are to be the basis for estimating, scheduling, and running the project. A, B, and C are incorrect because work scheduling is part of the follow-on process, as are estimating tasks and scheduling activities."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "You note that your weekly time sheet report shows that you have identified activities, scoped the work needed on each, and provided sufficient detail to allow a team member to understand what is required to complete that work. What description summarizes the time you have spent this week?", "choices": ["A.  Producing an activity list", "B.  Defining the project scope", "C.  Developing the project schedule", "D.  Identifying the WBS elements"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The activity list is a comprehensive list of all scheduled activities, including scope and activity identifier, that is in sufficient detail for a team member to complete the work. B is incorrect because defining the project scope is an earlier stage and does not break the project into detailed work packages. C is incorrect because defining and developing the project schedule is a later stage of planning. D is incorrect because the WBS elements already will have been identified prior to this activity."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "The precedence diagramming method can be used to clarify the dependencies between activities. One type of dependency used is to ensure that the successor activity does not start until the completion of the predecessor activity.

The type of dependency in which the successor activity does not start until the completion of a predecessor activity is known as finish-to-start. A is incorrect because in the start-to-start dependency a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has started. B is incorrect because in the finish-to-finish dependency a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished. D is incorrect because in the start-to-finish dependency a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has started."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "One tool of project management is a table that identifies and describes the types and quantities of each resource required to complete all project work packages. What is this table known as?", "choices": ["A.  Resource calendar updates", "B.  Activity attribute updates", "C.  Resource breakdown structure", "D.  Activity resource requirements"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. A list that identifies and describes the types and quantities of each resource required to complete all project work packages is known as the activity resource requirements. A, B, and C are incorrect because the resource calendar, activity attribute updates, and resource breakdown structure are outputs of activity resource estimating but are not the correct answers."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "You are completing the planning for a project schedule.

This calculation method is called:", "choices": ["A.  Analogous estimating", "B.  Expert judgment", "C.  Parametric estimating", "D.  Reserve analysis"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Estimating the duration of a project activity by referring to the actual duration of a similar activity on another project is known as analogous estimating. B is incorrect because expert judgment uses other specialists to modify historical data. C is incorrect because parametric estimating uses pro-rata data. D is incorrect because reserve analysis refers to contingency or time buffers."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "Your project manager asks you to calculate the theoretical early start and finish dates on your project schedule, along with late start and finish dates, for all the project activities.

What-if analysis"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Calculating the theoretical early start and finish dates, along with late start and finish dates, for all the project activities using a forward and backward pass analysis is known as the critical path method. A is incorrect because the critical chain method is specifically related to resource constraints. C is incorrect because schedule compression is about reducing project duration. D is incorrect because what-if analysis relates to calculating the durations of multiple combinations of tasks."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "You are asked to review a project that another department has planned for your organization. Your line manager asks you to show her a project overview that shows only the start and end dates of major deliverables, along with key external dependencies.

A project overview that shows only the start and end of major deliverables, along with key external dependencies, is known as a milestone chart. A and B are incorrect because network diagrams and summary bar charts are used for more detailed presentation; they also show dependencies and durations of tasks. D is incorrect because the schedule baseline is a detailed chart."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "While reviewing a work package that you have assigned to a member of your team, you look at a graphic that shows the activity start, duration, and finish on a time base. This chart is commonly known as a(n):", "choices": ["A.  Activity float list", "B.  Network diagram", "C.  Work breakdown structure", "D.  Project bar chart"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. A graphic that shows the activity start, duration, and finish on a time base is known as a project bar chart.

You have authority for a reference that contains an activity schedule and project start and finish dates. This reference is called:", "choices": ["A.  The project schedule baseline", "B.  A network diagram", "C.  A milestone chart", "D.  The project calendar"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. The activity schedule, with project start and finish dates, is known as the project schedule baseline. B is incorrect because a network diagram shows dependencies only. C is incorrect because a milestone chart is a summary that does not show the activity schedule. D is incorrect because the project calendar is a detailed view of working and nonworking days for the project and resources."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "You are asked to develop a table that includes the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes, and documented assumptions and constraints.

The project sponsor expects a narrower estimate of the costs because more information is now known. Which of the following is considered a suitable range for this request?", "choices": ["A.  \u2013100% to +100%", "B.  \u20135% to +10%", "C.  \u201325% to +25%", "D.  \u201350% to +50%"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. As more information becomes known later in the project, estimates could narrow to a range of \u20135% to +10% (a definitive estimate). A, C, and D are incorrect because earlier in a project, for example, in the initiation stage, estimates could use a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate in the range of \u201325 to +75%."},
            {"id": 16, "quiz": "A project team member is building the costs for a current project, using costs from a previous similar project that has been completed in your organization.
