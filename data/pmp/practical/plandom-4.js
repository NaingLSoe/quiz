Team performance assessment"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The organizational process assets that can influence the Manage Team process can include certificates of appreciation, newsletters, websites, bonus structures, corporate apparel, and other organizational perquisites. A is incorrect because staff roles and responsibilities are related to individuals, not the performance. C is incorrect because the staffing management plan is a list or schedule of work for staff. D is incorrect because team performance assessment is related to the team members explicitly."},
            {"id": 2, "quiz": "A project manager must perform many activities when planning and managing a project. These include developing an approach for stakeholder information needs; creating, collecting, distributing, storing, and disposing of project information; and monitoring and controlling communications.

Project communications management"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. Developing an approach for stakeholder information needs; creating, collecting, distributing, storing, and disposing of project information; and monitoring and controlling communications are examples of project communications planning. A, B, and C are incorrect because recommended preventive actions, project performance appraisals, and recommended corrective actions are all inputs to the team management process in operation during a project."},
            {"id": 3, "quiz": "A section of your project plan lists methods and technologies to be used to convey memoranda, email, press releases, and how frequently these should be used. The document that defines these is called a(n):", "choices": ["A.  Communications management plan", "B.  Organizational assets", "C.  Communications technology", "D.  Project management plan"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Methods and technologies to be used to convey memoranda, emails, press releases, and how frequently these should be used are examples of the contents of a communications management plan. B is incorrect because organizational assets are related to processes and procedures that the organization has in place. C is incorrect because communications technology is about the technology only. D is incorrect because the project management plan is a higher-level document that does not contain the detail of the communications management plan."},
            {"id": 4, "quiz": "During the planning stage of a project, you decide to assign a member of your project team to be responsible for the distribution of information about the project. Where should you document this decision?", "choices": ["A.  Project management plan", "B.  Communications management plan", "C.  Project roles and responsibilities", "D.  Project team assessment"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. The staff member responsible for the distribution of information about the project is defined in the communications management plan. A is incorrect because the project management plan is the higher-level document that contains the communications management plan within it. C is incorrect because project roles and responsibilities are related to task responsibilities. D is incorrect because project team assessment is a process of measurement performed during a project."},
            {"id": 5, "quiz": "To be successful, how often should an organization address risk management?", "choices": ["A.  At every management meeting", "B.  Only in the planning phase", "C.  On high-risk projects only", "D.  Consistently throughout"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. An organization should be committed to addressing risk management proactively and consistently throughout the project. A, B, and C are incorrect because risk needs to be identified early with mitigation strategies in place and then constantly monitored as the details of the project are progressively elaborated to ensure that new risks have not been introduced."},
            {"id": 6, "quiz": "The project director advises you that a project should have a balance between risk taking and risk avoidance. This policy is implemented in a project using:", "choices": ["A.  Risk responses", "B.  Risk analysis", "C.  Risk identification", "D.  Risk classification"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. A balance between risk taking and risk avoidance is the application of risk responses. B, C, and D are incorrect because risk analysis, risk identification, and risk classification are parts of prior steps to the responses in the risk management process."},
            {"id": 7, "quiz": "Who is responsible for identifying risks in a new project?", "choices": ["A.  The project manager", "B.  The project sponsor", "C.  Any project personnel", "D.  The main stakeholders"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Any project personnel can identify risks in a project. A, B, and D are incorrect because the project manager manages the risk management process with input from the sponsor and main stakeholders."},
            {"id": 8, "quiz": "The document that contains a list of identified risks and, against each a list of potential responses, the root cause of the risk, and the risk category is called the:", "choices": ["A.  Risk management plan", "B.  Project issues log", "C.  Risk category checklist", "D.  Risk register"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. A list of identified risks, and against each a list of potential responses, the root cause of the risk, and the risk category, are the basic fields in a risk register. A is incorrect because the risk management plan is the overall management document and processes definitions for managing risk in the project. B is incorrect because the project issues log contains the list of all issues, not solely risks. C is incorrect because the risk category checklist contains weighting information on probability and impact."},
            {"id": 9, "quiz": "As part of your responsibility for managing risks in your project, you rate risks as low, medium, or high. What tool would you typically use to define these categories?", "choices": ["A.  Probability impact matrix", "B.  Risk register updates", "C.  Assumption analysis", "D.  Checklist analysis"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. Rating risks into a low, medium, or high category is done and presented on a probability impact matrix. B is incorrect because risk register updates are an output from the risk management process. C and D are incorrect because assumption analysis and checklist analysis are tools used for risk identification."},
            {"id": 10, "quiz": "A new member of your project team suggests that you should quantify risks using the lowest, highest, and most likely costs of the WBS elements in the project plan. What is the name for the technique being suggested?", "choices": ["A.  Three-point estimating", "B.  Probability impact analysis", "C.  Probability distributions", "D.  Sensitivity analysis"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. A technique that is often used for risk analysis that calculates or obtains information on the lowest, highest, and most likely costs of the WBS elements in the project plan is called three-point estimating. B is incorrect because probability impact analysis is a ranking of risks. C is incorrect because probability distributions are the application of three-point estimates in differing ways. D is incorrect because sensitivity analysis is used to test the major project variables independently for risks."},
            {"id": 11, "quiz": "The process of project planning that involves developing options, determining actions to enhance opportunities, and reducing threats to project objectives is called:", "choices": ["A.  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis", "B.  Plan Risk Responses", "C.  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis", "D.  Probability and Impact Matrix"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Developing options, determining actions to enhance opportunities, and reducing threats to project objectives is known as Plan Risk Responses. A and C are incorrect because Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are prior steps in the risk management process. D is incorrect because the probability and impact matrix is a means of classifying the ranking of risks."},
            {"id": 12, "quiz": "Your team is developing a part of the risk management plan. For some of the risks, the team decides that a response plan will be executed only when certain predefined conditions exist. What is the term given to this type of risk strategy?", "choices": ["A.  Contingent", "B.  Sharing", "C.  Exploit", "D.  Enhance"], "ans": 1, "reason": " A. For some of the risks in a project, particularly those that pose a threat as well as an opportunity, a response plan that will be executed only when certain predefined conditions exist is called a contingent response strategy. B, C, and D are incorrect because sharing, exploiting, and enhancing are responses to opportunities related to risk events."},
            {"id": 13, "quiz": "Information such as outcomes of risk reassessments, risk audits, and periodic risk reviews are examples from which of the following?", "choices": ["A.  Risk management plan", "B.  Approved change requests", "C.  Project documents updates", "D.  Work performance information"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. Information such as outcomes of risk reassessments, risk audits, and periodic risk reviews are examples of project document updates from the Monitor Risk process. A is incorrect because the risk management plan defines the process and resources involved in managing the risks. B and D are incorrect because approved change requests and work performance information do not match the question items."},
            {"id": 14, "quiz": "During the Plan Procurement Management process for a project, you decide whether a product or service can be produced by the project team or instead should be purchased. This decision-making process is called:", "choices": ["A.  Procurement management", "B.  Expert judgment", "C.  Risk management", "D.  Make-or-buy analysis"], "ans": 4, "reason": " D. The process of deciding whether a particular product or service can be produced by the project team or instead should be purchased is known as make-or-buy analysis. A is incorrect because procurement management is the process used to manage contracts. B is incorrect because expert judgment is a technique used in many decision-making processes. C is incorrect because risk management is a process related to risks in the project and does not document into the make-or-buy analysis."},
            {"id": 15, "quiz": "The contract you are negotiating with a subcontractor involves a set price for a well-defined requirement and incentives for meeting selected objectives. This type of contract is:", "choices": ["A.  Time and material", "B.  Cost-reimbursable", "C.  Fixed-price", "D.  Cost plus incentive"], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. A contract that involves a fixed price for a well-defined requirement, possibly with incentives for meeting selected objectives, is a fixed-price contract. A is incorrect because time and material contracts contain both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price arrangements. B is incorrect because a cost-reimbursable contract defines allowable costs plus profit. D is incorrect because a cost plus incentive contract contains fixed agreed-upon costs plus incentives based on performance."},
            {"id": 16, "quiz": "The procurement and contracting process involves asking such questions as how well the seller meets the contract statement of work, whether the seller has the capacity to meet future requirements, and whether the seller can provide references from previous customers. What is the name given to this list and/or its use?", "choices": ["A.  Contract management", "B.  Source selection criteria", "C.  Supplier risk analysis", "D.  Contract negotiation"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. How well the seller meets the contract statement of work, whether the seller has the capacity to meet future requirements, and whether the seller can provide references from previous customers are examples of contract source selection criteria. A is incorrect because contract management is the overall process of managing contracts. C is incorrect because supplier risk analysis is part of risk management. D is incorrect because contract negotiation occurs after source selection criteria have been decided and analyzed."},
            {"id": 17, "quiz": "Your contract and procurement consultant recommends that you establish source selection criteria for each of your sellers' proposals. What part of the procurement process will this assist?", "choices": ["A.  Bidder conference", "B.  Plan Procurement Management", "C.  Conduct Procurements", "D.  Buyer requests"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. Establishing source selection criteria for each of your sellers' proposals helps to rate or score seller proposals. These source selection criteria are an output of the Plan Procurement Management. A is incorrect because the bidder conference is an open meeting prior to the proposals being delivered. C is incorrect because the source selection criteria are used as an input in the Conduct Procurements process, but are created in the earlier process. D is incorrect because buyer requests refer to the customer's needs."},
            {"id": 18, "quiz": "Using the following part of a WBS, what do you know about Activity 3.1.1?", "choices": ["A.  It is a control account.", "B.  It is used for cost reporting.", "C.  It is the work package.", "D.  It is the milestone above the work package."], "ans": 3, "reason": " C. The WBS entry 3.1.1 Interview Stakeholders is a work package and identifies activity tasks to be carried out to complete the project. A, B, and D are incorrect because 3.1.1 is a work package, not a control account, and although each work package is part of a control account, which enables the project manager to compare work completed to earned value objectives, the work package itself is not a control account.",

            {"id": 19, "quiz": "You and your team are estimating the duration of the coding/unit testing phase. Your optimistic estimate is 1,200 hours, your most likely estimate is 1,700 hours, and your pessimistic estimate is 2,000 hours. The resource rate is $150 per hour. What is your cost estimate of the coding/unit test phase using the PERT estimating technique?", "choices": ["A.  $255,000", "B.  $250,050", "C.  $280,325", "D.  $270,175"], "ans": 2, "reason": " B. PERT = (o + 4m + p) / 6 with o = 1200, m = 1700, and p = 2000. Substituting these numbers, PERT = (1200 + 4(1700) + 2000) / 6, or (1200 + 6800 + 2000) / 6 or 10,000 / 6, or 1,667 hours. Because the labor rate is $150/hour, 1667 \u00d7 150 = $250,050. A, C, and D are incorrect because the answers do not come from using the PERT formula."},
            {"id": 20, "quiz": "The business case stated a project cost of $2,500,000. You and your team just received the signed project charter and are ready to present a high-level estimate to the project management team.

The math is $2,500,000 \u00d7 \u221225% = $1,187,500 and $2,500,000 \u00d7 75% = $4,375,000. Order of magnitude (OOM) estimates are rough guesses made at the very beginning of the project. In the initiation stage of a project, not much is known about the project, and things change as planning progresses. B, C, and D are incorrect because they did not use estimates at initiation that may have a range of \u221225 to +75%."},
