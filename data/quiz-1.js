Based on your analysis and understanding, you are confident that the project would be completed with a total cost of $108,000. You also estimate that a best case would be $90000, while a worst-case scenario would result in the costs incurred to shoot up to $138000. What would the Three Point Cost estimate be when using Beta Distribution?",

The formula for this estimation technique is 4a + b + c / 6, where a = Most Likely Estimate, b = Estimate based on Best-case scenario, and c = Estimate based on Worst-case scenario. So, the Three Point Estimate using Beta distribution is (4 *108000) + 90000 + 138000 / 6 = 660000/6 = $ 110000."

The project is about three-fourths done when the site engineer reports that due to inherent complexities in a certain task, the deliverables would get delayed. This would involve additional analysis and then implementation. He requests that this new work, which was not envisioned earlier, be added to the scope and also the time required be added to the schedule. You and the site engineer have analyzed the impact of this change to cost and have written up a change request and requested approval from change control board. Just today, you have received approval from the change control board. What should be the immediate course of action?",

Defect repair might sound tempting, but it is only applicable for the issues found in the current delivery. This is also not about Quality Control, so that leaves you with only two options: Corrective or Preventive actions. Corrective actions are always preceded by nonconformity, while preventive actions are never preceded by nonconformity. In this case, nonconformity in the form of a lot of issues during Quality Assurance were reported. The root cause was identified to be the need of a standard checklist which was later used. Preventive action is always taken proactively. In the question stated there is no demonstration of any proactive steps taken and hence this is not an example of Preventive action."

In such contracts, you, the buyer, needs to pay the seller for all the costs and also an agreed percentage of the cost. As a result, there is no motivation on the seller to control the costs; in fact, it is in the interest of the seller to increase the costs. It is not necessary that all projects should always be T and M or Fixed Price. Option A is clearly wrong since all the risks are, in fact, with the buyer and not the seller."

Integrated change control deals with formally approving or rejecting changes before they are implemented, so it is not the correct answer. Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique, so it too is not the correct answer. While Scope Creep is related to change in scope, it is related to uncontrolled changes in product or projects scope and is often due to client interference. Gold plating is done intentionally or knowingly for some strategic purpose. Here, the manager believes that by adding the extra features, future projects could be bagged."
